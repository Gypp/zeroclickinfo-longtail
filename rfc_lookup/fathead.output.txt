925	A			RFCs from 1984							"Multi-LAN address resolution" was released in October of 1984 by J. Postel. The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one Internet network has generated some interest and concern.  It is inappropriate to give each LAN within an site a distinct Internet network number.  It is desirable to hide the details of the interconnections between the LANs within an site from people, gateways, and hosts outside the site.  The question arises on how to best do this, and even how to do it at all.  In RFC-917 Jeffery Mogul makes a case for the use of "explicit subnets" in a multi-LAN environment.  The explicit subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms the Internet uses to manage networks to the problem of managing LANs within one network.  In this note I urge another approach: the use of "transparent subnets" supported by a multi-LAN extension of the Address Resolution Protocol.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc925.txt
926	A			RFCs from 1984							"Protocol for providing the connectionless mode network services" was released in December of 1984 by International Organization for Standardization. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+994">RFC 994</a>. This note is the draft ISO protocol roughly similar to the DOD Internet Protocol.  This document has been prepared by retyping the text of ISO DIS 8473 of May 1984, which is currently undergoing voting within ISO as a Draft International Standard (DIS).  This document is distributred as an RFC for information only.  It does not specify a standard for the ARPA-Internet.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc926.txt
927	A			RFCs from 1984							"TACACS user identification Telnet option" was released in December of 1984 by B.A. Anderson. The following is the description of a TELNET option designed to facilitate double login avoidance.  It is intended primarily for TAC connections to target hosts on behalf of TAC users, but it can be used between any two consenting hosts.  For example, all hosts at one site (e.g., BBN) can use this option to avoid double login when TELNETing to one another.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc927.txt
928	A			RFCs from 1984							"Introduction to proposed DoD standard H-FP" was released in December of 1984 by M.A. Padlipsky. The broad outline of the Host-Front End Protocol introduced here and described in RFC-929 is the result of the deliberations of a number of experienced H-FP designers, who sat as a committee of the DoD Protocol Standards Technical Panel.  It is the intent of the designers that the protocol be subjected to multiple test implementations and probable iteration before being agreed upon as any sort of "standard".  Therefore, the first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to request that any readers of these documents who are able to do test implementations (a) do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the author.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc928.txt
929	A			RFCs from 1984							"Proposed Host-Front End Protocol" was released in December of 1984 by J. Lilienkamp, M.A. Padlipsky, and R. Mandell. The Host-Front End Protocol introduced in RFC-928 is described in detail in this memo.  The first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to request that any readers of these documents who are able to do test implementations (a) do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the author.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc929.txt
930	A			RFCs from 1985							"Telnet terminal type option" was released in January of 1985 by M. Solomon, and E. Wimmers. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+884">RFC 884</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+1091">RFC 1091</a>. This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on the ARPA Internet that exchange terminal type information within the Telnet protocol are expected to adopt and implement this standard.  This standard supersedes RFC-884.  The only change is to specify that the TERMINAL-TYPE IS sub-negotiation should be sent only in response to the TERMINAL-TYPE SEND sub-negotiation.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc930.txt
931	A			RFCs from 1985							"Authentication server" was released in January of 1985 by M. St. Johns. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+912">RFC 912</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+1413">RFC 1413</a>. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is the second draft of this proposal (superseding RFC-912) and incorporates a more formal description of the syntax for the request and response dialog, as well as a change to specify the type of user identification returned.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc931.txt
932	A			RFCs from 1985							"Subnetwork addressing scheme" was released in January of 1985 by D.D. Clark. This RFC proposes an alternative addressing scheme for subnets which, in most cases, requires no modification to host software whatsoever.  The drawbacks of this scheme are that the total number of subnets in any one network are limited, and that modification is required to all gateways.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc932.txt
933	A			RFCs from 1985							"Output marking Telnet option" was released in January of 1985 by S. Silverman. This proposed option would allow a Server-Telnet to send a banner to a User-Telnet so that this banner would be displayed on the workstation screen independently of the application software running in the Server-Telnet.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc933.txt
934	A			RFCs from 1985							"Proposed standard for message encapsulation" was released in January of 1985 by E.A. Stefferud, and M.T. Rose. This memo concerns itself with message forwarding.  Forwarding can be thought of as encapsulating one or more messages inside another.  Although this is useful for transfer of past correspondence to new recipients, without a decapsulation process (which this memo terms "bursting"), the forwarded messages are of little use to the recipients because they can not be distributed, forwarded, replied-to, or otherwise processed as separate individual messages.  In order to burst a message it is necessary to know how the component messages were encapsulated in the draft.  At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest group digests.  This RFC proposes a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc934.txt
935	A			RFCs from 1985							"Reliable link layer protocols" was released in January of 1985 by J.G. Robinson. This RFC discusses protocols proposed recently in RFCs 914 and 916, and suggests a proposed protocol that could meet the same needs addressed in those memos.  The stated need is reliable communication between two programs over a full-duplex, point-to-point communication link, and in particular the RFCs address the need for such communication over an asynchronous link at relatively low speeds.  The suggested protocol uses the methods of existing national and international data link layer standards.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc935.txt
936	A			RFCs from 1985							"Another Internet subnet addressing scheme" was released in February of 1985 by M.J. Karels. There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a simplified view of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of this collection.  They allow the complexity of the number and type of these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.  Additions and changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other information outside of the local environment.  These schemes also simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.  This proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc936.txt
937	A			RFCs from 1985							"Post Office Protocol: Version 2" was released in February of 1985 by J. Postel, M. Butler, D. Chase, J.K. Reynolds, and J. Goldberger. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+918">RFC 918</a>. This RFC suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access mail from a mailbox server.  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvement.  This memo is a revision of RFC-918.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc937.txt
938	A			RFCs from 1985							"Internet Reliable Transaction Protocol functional and interface specification" was released in February of 1985 by T. Miller. This RFC is being distributed to members of the DARPA research community in order to solicit their reactions to the proposals contained in it.  While the issues discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems of the DARPA community, they may be interesting to a number of researchers and implementors.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc938.txt
939	A			RFCs from 1985							"Executive summary of the NRC report on transport protocols for Department of Defense data networks" was released in February of 1985 by National Research Council. This RFC reproduces the material from the "front pages" of the National Research Council report resulting from a study of the DOD Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in comparison with the ISO Internet Protocol (ISO-IP) and Transport Protocol level 4 (TP-4).  The point of this RFC is to make the text of the Executive Summary widely available in a timely way.  The order of presentation has been altered, and the pagination changed.  This RFC is distributed for information only.  This RFC does not establish any policy for the DARPA research community or the DDN operational community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc939.txt
940	A			RFCs from 1985							"Toward an Internet standard scheme for subnetting" was released in April of 1985 by Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures Task Force. Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity are of little interest to the rest of the Internet.  One way of organizing these local complexes of links is to use the same strategy as the Internet uses to organize networks, that is, to declare each link to be an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the links with devices that perform routing functions (like gateways).  This general scheme is called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).  This RFC discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted environments in the ARPA-Internet.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc940.txt
941	A			RFCs from 1985							"Addendum to the network service definition covering network layer addressing" was released in April of 1985 by International Organization for Standardization. This Addendum to the Network Service Definition Standard, ISO 8348, defines the abstract syntax and semantics of the Network Address (Network Service Access Point Address).  The Network Address defined in this Addendum is the address that appears in the primitives of the connection-mode Network Service as the calling address, called address, and responding address parameters, and in the primitives of the connectionless-mode Network Service as the source address and destination address parameters.  This document is distributed as an RFC for information only.  It does not specify a standard for the ARPA-Internet.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc941.txt
942	A			RFCs from 1985							"Transport protocols for Department of Defense data networks" was released in February of 1985 by National Research Council. This RFC reproduces the National Research Council report resulting from a study of the DoD Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in comparison with the ISO Internet Protocol (ISO-IP) and Transport Protocol level 4 (TP-4).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc942.txt
943	A			RFCs from 1985							"Assigned numbers" was released in April of 1985 by J. Postel, and J.K. Reynolds. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+923">RFC 923</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+960">RFC 960</a>. This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.  This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.  The assignment of numbers is also handled by Joyce.  If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, network number, etc., please contact Joyce to receive a number assignment.  This memo is an official status report on the numbers used in protocols in the ARPA-Internet community.  See RFC-990 and 997.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc943.txt
944	A			RFCs from 1985							"Official ARPA-Internet protocols" was released in April of 1985 by J. Postel, and J.K. Reynolds. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+924">RFC 924</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+961">RFC 961</a>. This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols used in the Internet.  This edition of Official ARPA-Internet Protocols obsoletes RFC-924 and earlier editions.  This RFC will be updated periodically, and current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.  This memo is an official status report on the protocols used in the ARPA-Internet community.  See RFC-991.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc944.txt
945	A			RFCs from 1985							"DoD statement on the NRC report" was released in May of 1985 by J. Postel. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+1039">RFC 1039</a>. In May 1983 the National Research Council (NRC) was asked jointly by DoD and NBS to study the issues and recommend a course of action.  The final report of the NRC committee was published in February 1985 (see RFC-942).  The enclosed letter is from Donald C.  Latham (ASDC3I) to DCA transmitting the NRC report and requesting specific actions relative to the recommendations of the report.  This RFC reproduces a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I) to the Director of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA).  This letter is distributed for information only.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc945.txt
946	A			RFCs from 1985							"Telnet terminal location number option" was released in May of 1985 by R. Nedved. Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged in from usually including information about telephone extension and office occupants names.  The information is useful for physically locating people and/or calling them on the phone.  In 1982 CMU designed and implemented a terminal location database and modified existing network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal Location Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems appropriate to incorporate this mechanism into the TCP-based network protocol family.  The mechanism is not viewed as a replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand mechansim for communicating terminal location information between hosts in a localized community.  This RFC proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc946.txt
947	A			RFCs from 1985							"Multi-network broadcasting within the Internet" was released in June of 1985 by K. Lebowitz, and D. Mankins. This RFC describes the extension of a network's broadcast domain to include more than one physical network through the use of a broadcast packet repeater.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc947.txt
948	A			RFCs from 1985							"Two methods for the transmission of IP datagrams over IEEE 802.3 networks" was released in June of 1985 by I. Winston. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+1042">RFC 1042</a>. This RFC describes two methods of encapsulating Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams on an IEEE 802.3 network.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc948.txt
949	A			RFCs from 1985							"FTP unique-named store command" was released in July of 1985 by M.A. Padlipsky. There are various contexts in which it would be desirable to have an FTP command that had the effect of the present STOR but rather than requiring the sender to specify a file name istead caused the resultant file to have a unique name relative to the current directory.  This RFC proposes an extension to the File Transfer Protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  See RFC-959.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc949.txt
950	A			RFCs from 1985							"Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure" was released in August of 1985 by J. Postel, and J.C. Mogul. This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network.  For administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers.  This memo specifies procedures for the use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).  The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully described.  Important motivation and background information for a subnetting standard is provided in RFC-940.  This RFC specifies a protocol for the ARPA-Internet community.  If subnetting is implemented it is strongly recommended that these procedures be followed.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc950.txt
951	A			RFCs from 1985							"Bootstrap Protocol" was released in September of 1985 by J. Gilmore, and W.J. Croft. This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and executed.  The bootstrap operation can be thought of as consisting of TWO PHASES.  This RFC describes the first phase, which could be labeled `address determination and bootfile selection'.  After this address and filename information is obtained, control passes to the second phase of the bootstrap where a file transfer occurs.  The file transfer will typically use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended that both phases reside in PROM on the client.  However BOOTP could also work with other protocols such as SFTP or FTP.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc951.txt
952	A			RFCs from 1985							"DoD Internet host table specification" was released in October of 1985 by E.J. Feinler, M.K. Stahl, and K. Harrenstien. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+810">RFC 810</a>. This RFC is the official specification of the format of the Internet Host Table.  This edition of the specification includes minor revisions to RFC-810 which brings it up to date.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc952.txt
953	A			RFCs from 1985							"Hostname Server" was released in October of 1985 by E.J. Feinler, M.K. Stahl, and K. Harrenstien. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+811">RFC 811</a>.

954	A			RFCs from 1985							"NICNAME/WHOIS" was released in October of 1985 by E.J. Feinler, M.K. Stahl, and K. Harrenstien. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+812">RFC 812</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+3912">RFC 3912</a>. This RFC is the official specification of the NICNAME/WHOIS protocol.  This memo describes the protocol and the service.  This is an update of RFC-812.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc954.txt
955	A			RFCs from 1985							"Towards a transport service for transaction processing applications" was released in September of 1985 by R.T. Braden. The DoD Internet protocol suite includes two alternative transport service protocols, TCP and UDP, which provide virtual circuit and datagram service, respectively.  These two protocols represent points in the space of possible transport service attributes which are quite "far apart".  We want to examine an important class of applications, those which perform what is often called "transaction processing".  We will see that the communication needs for these applications fall into the gap "between" TCP and UDP -- neither protocol is very appropriate.  This RFC is concerned with the possible design of one or more new protocols for the ARPA-Internet, to support kinds of applications which are not well supported at present.  The RFC is intended to spur discussion in the Internet research community towards the development of new protocols and/or concepts, in order to meet these unmet application requirements.  It does not represent a standard, nor even a concrete protocol proposal.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc955.txt
956	A			RFCs from 1985							"Algorithms for synchronizing network clocks" was released in September of 1985 by D.L. Mills. This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  The recent interest within the Internet community in determining accurate time from a set of mutually suspicious network clocks has been prompted by several occasions in which errors were found in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms which disrupted their power supply.  To these sources of error should be added those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator mistakes, as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and synchronize clocks.  This report suggests a stochastic model and algorithms for computing a good estimator from time-offset samples measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included in this report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an indication of the effectiveness of the algorithms.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc956.txt
957	A			RFCs from 1985							"Experiments in network clock synchronization" was released in September of 1985 by D.L. Mills. This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  One of the services frequently neglected in computer network design is a high-quality, time-of-day clock capable of generating accurate timestamps with small errors compared to one-way network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring network performance and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock service design will be described and its performance assessed.  This design has been incorporated as an integral part of the network routing and control protocols of the Distributed Computer Network (DCnet) architecture.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc957.txt
958	A			RFCs from 1985							"Network Time Protocol (NTP)" was released in September of 1985 by D.L. Mills. This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a protocol for synchronizing a set of network clocks using a set of distributed clients and servers.  NTP is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless transport mechanism.  It is evolved from the Time Protocol and the ICMP Timestamp message and is a suitable replacement for both.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc958.txt
959	A			RFCs from 1985							"File Transfer Protocol" was released in October of 1985 by J. Reynolds, and J. Postel. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+765">RFC 765</a>. This memo is the official specification of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for the DARPA Internet community.  The primary intent is to clarify and correct the documentation of the FTP specification, not to change the protocol.  The following new optional commands are included in this edition of the specification: Change to Parent Directory (CDUP), Structure Mount (SMNT), Store Unique (STOU), Remove Directory (RMD), Make Directory (MKD), Print Directory (PWD), and System (SYST).  Note that this specification is compatible with the previous edition.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc959.txt

This edition of the Official Protocols updates and obsoletes RFC-944.  This memo is an official status report on the protocols used in the ARPA-Internet community.  See RFC-991.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc961.txt
962	A			RFCs from 1985							"TCP-4 prime" was released in November of 1985 by M.A. Padlipsky. This memo is in response to Bob Braden's call for a transaction oriented protocol (RFC-955), and continues the discussion of a possible transaction oriented transport protocol.  This memo does not propose a standard.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc962.txt
963	A			RFCs from 1985							"Some problems with the specification of the Military Standard Internet Protocol" was released in November of 1985 by D.P. Sidhu. The purpose of this RFC is to provide helpful information on the Military Standard Internet Protocol (MIL-STD-1777) so that one can obtain a reliable implementation of this protocol.

964	A			RFCs from 1985							"Some problems with the specification of the Military Standard Transmission Control Protocol" was released in November of 1985 by D.P. Sidhu, and T. Blumer. The purpose of this RFC is to provide helpful information on the Military Standard Transmission Control Protocol (MIL-STD-1778) so that one can obtain a reliable implementation of this protocol standard.  This note points out three errors with this specification.  This note also proposes solutions to these problems.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc964.txt
965	A			RFCs from 1985							"Format for a graphical communication protocol" was released in December of 1985 by L. Aguilar. This RFC describes the requirements for a graphical format on which to base a graphical on-line communication protocol, and proposes an Interactive Graphical Communication Format using the GKSM session metafile.  We hope this contribution will encourage the discussion of multimedia data exchange and the proposal of solutions.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc965.txt
966	A			RFCs from 1985							"Host groups: A multicast extension to the Internet Protocol" was released in December of 1985 by D.R. Cheriton, and S.E. Deering. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+988">RFC 988</a>. This RFC defines a model of service for Internet multicasting and proposes an extension to the Internet Protocol (IP) to support such a multicast service.  Discussion and suggestions for improvements are requested.  See RFC-988.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc966.txt
967	A			RFCs from 1985							"All victims together" was released in December of 1985 by M.A. Padlipsky. This RFC proposes a new set of RFCs on how the networking code is integrated with various operating systems.  It appears that this topic has not received enough exposure in the literature.  Comments and suggestions are encouraged.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc967.txt
968	A			RFCs from 1985							"Twas the night before start-up" was released in December of 1985 by V.G. Cerf. This memo discusses problems that arise and debugging techniques used in bringing a new network into operation.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc968.txt
969	A			RFCs from 1985							"NETBLT: A bulk data transfer protocol" was released in December of 1985 by M.L. Lambert, L. Zhang, and D.D. Clark. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+998">RFC 998</a>. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is a preliminary discussion of the Network Block Transfer (NETBLT) protocol.  NETBLT is intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.  It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is structured to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.  This description is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not advised.

970	A			RFCs from 1985							"On Packet Switches With Infinite Storage" was released in December of 1985 by J. Nagle. The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution.  Most prior work on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management.  In this memo the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered.  Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers.  It can, however, still become congested.  The meaning of congestion in an infinite-storage system is explored.  An unexpected result is found that shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime will, under overload, drop all packets.  By attacking the problem of congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions applicable to switches with finite storage may be found.  No proposed solutions this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this time.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc970.txt

This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the ARPA Internet community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session, presentation, and application recommendations which have been adopted by the international community and numerous vendors.  To the largest extent possible, it is desirable to offer these higher level services directly in the ARPA Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.  The intention is that hosts in the ARPA-Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this standard.  Suggestions for improvement are encouraged.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc983.txt
984	A			RFCs from 1986							"PCMAIL: A distributed mail system for personal computers" was released in May of 1986 by M.L. Lambert, and D.D. Clark. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+993">RFC 993</a>. This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a personal-computer-based distributed mail system.  Pcmail is a distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists of a single entity called the "repository".  The repository is a storage center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally from the Internet or internally from other repository users.  The repository also maintains a stable copy of each user's mail state.  The repository is therefore typically a computer with a large amount of disk storage.  It is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not advised.  See RFC-993.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc984.txt

This memo describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), specifies its formal structure and summarizes information useful for its implementation.  NTP provides the mechanisms to synchronize time and coordinate time distribution in a large, diverse internet operating at rates from mundane to lightwave.  It uses a returnable-time design in which a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self- organizing, hierarchical master-slave configuration synchronizes logical clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or radio.  The servers can also redistribute reference time via local routing algorithms and time daemons.  The NTP architectures, algorithms and protocols which have evolved over several years of implementation and refinement are described in this document.  The prototype system, which has been in regular operation in the Internet for the last two years, is described in an Appendix along with performance data which shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout most portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds, even the cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or nets.

RFC 1006 describes a mechanism for providing the ISO transport service on top of TCP/IP.  Once this method is applied, one may implement "real" ISO applications on top of TCP/IP-based internets, by simply implementing OSI session, presentation, and application services on top of the transport service access point which is provided on top of the TCP.  Although straight-forward, there are some environments in which the richness provided by the OSI application layer is desired, but it is nonetheless impractical to implement the underlying OSI infrastructure (i.e., the presentation, session, and transport services on top of the TCP).  This memo describes an approach for providing "stream-lined" support of OSI application services on top of TCP/IP-based internets for such constrained environments.

1128	A			RFCs from 1989							"Measured performance of the Network Time Protocol in the Internet system" was released in October of 1989 by D.L. Mills. This paper describes a series of experiments involving over 100,000 hosts of the Internet system and located in the U.S., Europe and the Pacific.  The experiments are designed to evaluate the availability, accuracy and reliability of international standard time distribution using the DARPA/NSF Internet and the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is specified in RFC-1119.  NTP is designed specifically for use in a large, diverse internet system operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave.  In NTP a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave configuration exchange precision timestamps in order to synchronize subnet clocks to each other and national time standards via wire or radio.  The experiments are designed to locate Internet hosts and gateways that provide time by one of three time distribution protocols and evaluate the accuracy of their indications.  For those hosts that support NTP, the experiments determine the distribution of errors and other statistics over paths spanning major portions of the globe.  Finally, the experiments evaluate the accuracy and reliability of precision timekeeping using NTP and typical Internet paths involving DARPA, NSFNET and other agency networks.  The experiments demonstrate that timekeeping accuracy throughout most portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or networks.  This memo does not specify a standard.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1128.txt
1129	A			RFCs from 1989							"Internet Time Synchronization: The Network Time Protocol" was released in October of 1989 by D.L. Mills. This memo describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP) designed to distribute time information in a large, diverse internet system operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave.  It uses a returnable- time architecture in which a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave configuration synchronizes local clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or radio.  The servers can also redistribute time information within a network via local routing algorithms and time daemons.  The architectures, algorithms and protocols which have evolved to NTP over several years of implementation and refinement are described in this paper.  The synchronization subnet which has been in regular operation in the Internet for the last several years is described along with performance data which shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout most portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or networks.  This memo describes the Network Time Protocol in RFC-1119.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1129.txt

2219	A			RFCs from 1997							"Use of DNS Aliases for Network Services" was released in October of 1997 by M. Hamilton, and R. Wright. It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually CNAMEs) in the Domain Name Service (DNS - [RFC-1034, RFC-1035]) to refer to network services such as anonymous FTP [RFC-959] servers, Gopher [RFC- 1436] servers, and most notably World-Wide Web HTTP [RFC-1945] servers.  This is desirable for a number of reasons.  It provides a way of moving services from one machine to another transparently, and a mechanism by which people or agents may programmatically discover that an organization runs, say, a World-Wide Web server.  Although this approach has been almost universally adopted, there is no standards document or similar specification for these commonly used names.  This document seeks to rectify this situation by gathering together the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions, and proposes a mechanism for accommodating new protocols.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2219.txt

2270	A			RFCs from 1998							"Using a Dedicated AS for Sites  Homed to a Single Provider" was released in January of 1998 by E. Chen, T. Bates, J. Stewart, and R. Chandra. With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers using BGP4 has grown significantly.  RFC1930 outlines a set of guidelines for when one needs and should use an AS.  However, the customer and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a result of this in that while there is no need for an allocated AS under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a single ISP.  This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with recommendations set forth in RFC1930.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2270.txt

2290	A			RFCs from 1998							"Mobile-IPv4 Configuration Option for PPP IPCP" was released in February of 1998 by S. Glass, and J. Solomon. Mobile IP [RFC 2002] defines media-independent procedures by which a Mobile Node can maintain existing transport and application-layer connections despite changing its point-of-attachment to the Internet and without changing its IP address.  PPP [RFC 1661] provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol packets over point-to-point links.  As currently specified, Mobile IP Foreign Agents which support Mobile Node connections via PPP can do so only by first assigning unique addresses to those Mobile Nodes, defeating one of the primary advantages of Foreign Agents.  This documents corrects this problem by defining the Mobile-IPv4 Configuration Option to the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) [RFC 1332].  Using this option, two peers can communicate their support for Mobile IP during the IPCP phase of PPP.  Familiarity with Mobile IP [RFC 2002], IPCP [RFC 1332], and PPP [RFC 1661] is assumed.

2997	A			RFCs from 2000							"Specification of the Null Service Type" was released in November of 2000 by A. Smith, Y. Bernet, and B. Davie. The Null Service allows applications to identify themselves to network Quality of Service (QoS) policy agents, using RSVP signaling.  However, it does not require them to specify resource requirements.  QoS policy agents in the network respond by applying QoS policies appropriate for the application (as determined by the network administrator).  This mode of RSVP usage is particularly applicable to networks that combine differentiated service (diffserv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP signaling.  In this environment, QoS policy agents may direct the signaled application's traffic to a particular diffserv class of service. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2997.txt

A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides mechanisms whereby service agent clients can advertise and user agent clients can query for services.  The design is very much demand-driven, so that user agents only obtain service information when they specifically ask for it.  There exists another class of user agent applications, however, that requires notification when a new service appears or disappears.  In the RFC 2608 design, these applications are forced to poll the network to catch changes.

3220	A			RFCs from 2002							"IP Mobility Support for IPv4" was released in January of 2002 by C. Perkins. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2002">RFC 2002</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+3344">RFC 3344</a>. This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3220.txt

3230	A			RFCs from 2002							"Instance Digests in HTTP" was released in January of 2002 by J. Mogul, and A. Van Hoff. HTTP/1.1 defines a Content-MD5 header that allows a server to include a digest of the response body.  However, this is specifically defined to cover the body of the actual message, not the contents of the full file (which might be quite different, if the response is a Content-Range, or uses a delta encoding).  Also, the Content-MD5 is limited to one specific digest algorithm; other algorithms, such as SHA-1 (Secure Hash Standard), may be more appropriate in some circumstances.  Finally, HTTP/1.1 provides no explicit mechanism by which a client may request a digest.  This document proposes HTTP extensions that solve these problems.

Crowcroft. For historical interest, this document captures the EF Design Team's proposed solution, preferred by the original authors of RFC 2598 but not adopted by the working group in December 2000.  The original definition of EF was based on comparison of forwarding on an unloaded network.  This experimental Delay Bound (DB) PHB requires a bound on the delay of packets due to other traffic in the network.  At the Pittsburgh IETF meeting in August 2000, the Differentiated Services working group faced serious questions regarding RFC 2598 - the group's standards track definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB).  An 'EF Design Team' volunteered to develop a re-expression of RFC 2598, bearing in mind the issues raised in the DiffServ group.  At the San Diego IETF meeting in December 2000 the DiffServ working group decided to pursue an alternative re-expression of the EF PHB.

Slutsman, J. Gato, I. Faynberg, and H. Lu. This document describes the SPIRITS protocol requirements, based on the architecture presented in RFC 3136. (SPIRITS stands for "Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting InTernet Service".) The purpose of the protocol is to support services that originate in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and necessitate the interactions between the PSTN and the Internet.  Similarly, such services are called SPIRITS services. (Internet Call Waiting, Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding are examples of SPIRIT services, but the protocol is to define the building blocks from which many other services can be built.) On the PSTN side, the SPIRITS services are initiated from the Intelligent Network (IN) entities; the earlier IETF work on the PSTN/Internet Interworking (PINT) resulted in the protocol (RFC 2848) in support of the services initiated the other way around--from the Internet to PSTN.  To this end, this document lists general requirements for the SPIRITS protocol as well as those pertinent to IN, Wireless IN, and PINT building blocks.  The document also presents the SPIRITS WG consensus on the choice of the SPIRITS signaling protocol.

3326	A			RFCs from 2002							"The Reason Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in December of 2002 by D. Oran, H. Schulzrinne, and G. Camarillo. The REGISTER function is used in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) system primarily to associate a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as Contact: <sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP User Agent (UA).  The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling from the user's home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use.  This document defines an extension header field, "Path" which provides such a mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3326.txt

3424	A			RFCs from 2002							"IAB Considerations for UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF) Across Network Address Translation" was released in November of 2002 by IAB, and L. Daigle. As a result of the nature of Network Address Translation (NAT) Middleboxes, communicating endpoints that are separated by one or more NATs do not know how to refer to themselves using addresses that are valid in the addressing realms of their (current and future) peers.  Various proposals have been made for "UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF)" processes.  These are processes whereby some originating endpoint attempts to determine or fix the address (and port) by which it is known to another endpoint - e.g., to be able to use address data in the protocol exchange, or to advertise a public address from which it will receive connections.  This document outlines the reasons for which these proposals can be considered at best as short term fixes to specific problems and the specific issues to be carefully evaluated before creating an UNSAF proposal.

The IQUERY method of performing inverse DNS lookups, specified in RFC 1035, has not been generally implemented and has usually been operationally disabled where it has been implemented.  Both reflect a general view in the community that the concept was unwise and that the widely-used alternate approach of using pointer (PTR) queries and reverse-mapping records is preferable.

It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5727">RFC 5727</a>. This memo documents a process intended to apply architectural discipline to the future development of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  There have been concerns with regards to new SIP proposals.  Specifically, that the addition of new SIP features can be damaging towards security and/or greatly increase the complexity of the protocol.  The Transport Area directors, along with the SIP and Session Initiation Proposal Investigation (SIPPING) working group chairs, have provided suggestions for SIP modifications and extensions.

3428	A			RFCs from 2002							"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Instant Messaging" was released in December of 2002 by J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne, D. Gurle, C. Huitema, and B. Campbell. Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between users in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not required to be, short.  IMs are often used in a conversational mode, that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.  This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of that protocol.  MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3428.txt

3432	A			RFCs from 2002							"Network performance measurement with periodic streams" was released in November of 2002 by A. Morton, G. Grotefeld, and V. Raisanen. This memo describes a periodic sampling method and relevant metrics for assessing the performance of IP networks.  First, the memo motivates periodic sampling and addresses the question of its value as an alternative to the Poisson sampling described in RFC 2330.  The benefits include applicability to active and passive measurements, simulation of constant bit rate (CBR) traffic (typical of multimedia communication, or nearly CBR, as found with voice activity detection), and several instances in which analysis can be simplified.  The sampling method avoids predictability by mandating random start times and finite length tests.  Following descriptions of the sampling method and sample metric parameters, measurement methods and errors are discussed.  Finally, we give additional information on periodic measurements, including security considerations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3432.txt

This document describes an application programming interface and a corresponding protocol (MGCP) which is used between elements of a decomposed multimedia gateway.  The decomposed multimedia gateway consists of a Call Agent, which contains the call control "intelligence", and a media gateway which contains the media functions, e.g., conversion from TDM voice to Voice over IP.  Media gateways contain endpoints on which the Call Agent can create, modify and delete connections in order to establish and control media sessions with other multimedia endpoints.  Also, the Call Agent can instruct the endpoints to detect certain events and generate signals.  The endpoints automatically communicate changes in service state to the Call Agent.  Furthermore, the Call Agent can audit endpoints as well as the connections on endpoints.  The basic and general MGCP protocol is defined in this document, however most media gateways will need to implement one or more MGCP packages, which define extensions to the protocol suitable for use with specific types of media gateways.  Such packages are defined in separate documents.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3435.txt

The user of TLS can take advantage of the features provided by SCTP, namely the support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking and the support of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.  Additionally, discussions of extensions of SCTP are also supported, meaning especially the support of dynamic reconfiguration of IP- addresses.

3437	A			RFCs from 2002							"Layer-Two Tunneling Protocol Extensions for PPP Link Control Protocol Negotiation" was released in December of 2002 by W. Townsley, and W. Palter. This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) for enhanced support of link-specific Point to Point Protocol (PPP) options.  PPP endpoints typically have direct access to the common physical media connecting them and thus have detailed knowledge about the media that is in use.  When the L2TP is used, the two PPP peers are no longer directly connected over the same physical media.  Instead, L2TP inserts a virtual connection over some or all of the PPP connection by tunneling PPP frames over a packet switched network such as IP.  Under some conditions, an L2TP endpoint may need to negotiate PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) options at a location which may not have access to all of the media information necessary for proper participation in the LCP negotiation.  This document provides a mechanism for communicating desired LCP options between L2TP endpoints in advance of PPP LCP negotiation at the far end of an L2TP tunnel, as well as a mechanism for communicating the negotiated LCP options back to where the native PPP link resides.

3445	A			RFCs from 2002							"Limiting the Scope of the KEY Resource Record (RR)" was released in December of 2002 by D. Massey, and S. Rose. This document limits the Domain Name System (DNS) KEY Resource Record (RR) to only keys used by the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  The original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC keys and arbitrary application keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and application keys with the same record type is a mistake.  This document removes application keys from the KEY record by redefining the Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data.  As a result of removing application keys, all but one of the flags in the KEY record become unnecessary and are redefined.

3448	A			RFCs from 2003							"TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification" was released in January of 2003 by J. Widmer, J. Padhye, S. Floyd, and M. Handley. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5348">RFC 5348</a>. This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best- effort Internet environment.  It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for applications such as telephony or streaming media where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.

3449	A			RFCs from 2002							"TCP Performance Implications of Network Path Asymmetry" was released in December of 2002 by H. Balakrishnan, G. Fairhurst, V. Padmanabhan, and M. Sooriyabandara. This document describes TCP performance problems that arise because of asymmetric effects.  These problems arise in several access networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks, for different underlying reasons.  However, the end result on TCP performance is the same in both cases: performance often degrades significantly because of imperfection and variability in the ACK feedback from the receiver to the sender.  The document details several mitigations to these effects, which have either been proposed or evaluated in the literature, or are currently deployed in networks.  These solutions use a combination of local link- layer techniques, subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of: (i) techniques to manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck link carrying the ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing the frequency of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self- clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in the reverse direction to improve performance in the presence of two-way traffic.  Each technique is described, together with known issues, and recommendations for use.  A summary of the recommendations is provided at the end of the document.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3449.txt

It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5775">RFC 5775</a>. This document describes the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) protocol, a massively scalable reliable content delivery protocol.  Asynchronous Layered Coding combines the Layered Coding Transport (LCT) building block, a multiple rate congestion control building block and the Forward Error Correction (FEC) building block to provide congestion controlled reliable asynchronous delivery of content to an unlimited number of concurrent receivers from a single sender.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3450.txt

This document generally describes how to use Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for data transport.  The primary focus of this document is the application of FEC codes to one-to-many reliable data transport using IP multicast.  This document describes what information is needed to identify a specific FEC code, what information needs to be communicated out-of-band to use the FEC code, and what information is needed in data packets to identify the encoding symbols they carry.  The procedures for specifying FEC codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  This document should be read in conjunction with and uses the terminology of the companion document titled, "The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast".

Handley. This memo describes the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for one-to-many reliable data transport using IP multicast.  One of the key properties of FEC codes in this context is the ability to use the same packets containing FEC data to simultaneously repair different packet loss patterns at multiple receivers.  Different classes of FEC codes and some of their basic properties are described and terminology relevant to implementing FEC in a reliable multicast protocol is introduced.  Examples are provided of possible abstract formats for packets carrying FEC.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3453.txt

This memo explores the requirements for host configuration in IPsec tunnel mode, and describes how the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4) may be leveraged for configuration.  In many remote access scenarios, a mechanism for making the remote host appear to be present on the local corporate network is quite useful.  This may be accomplished by assigning the host a "virtual" address from the corporate network, and then tunneling traffic via IPsec from the host's ISP-assigned address to the corporate security gateway.  In IPv4, DHCP provides for such remote host configuration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3456.txt

3459	A			RFCs from 2003							"Critical Content Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Parameter" was released in January of 2003 by E. Burger. This document describes the use of a mechanism for identifying body parts that a sender deems critical in a multi-part Internet mail message.  The mechanism described is a parameter to Content-Disposition, as described by RFC 3204.  By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing gateway services to systems of lesser capability.  Critical content can help a content gateway to decide what parts to forward.  It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to deliver a body part.  It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe to silently delete when a system of lesser capability receives a message.  In addition, critical content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the receiving system.  Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do some processing on a body part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the receiver must process.

3460	A			RFCs from 2003							"Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions" was released in January of 2003 by B. Moore. This document specifies a number of changes to the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM, RFC 3060).  Two types of changes are included.  First, several completely new elements are introduced, for example, classes for header filtering, that extend PCIM into areas that it did not previously cover.  Second, there are cases where elements of PCIM (for example, policy rule priorities) are deprecated, and replacement elements are defined (in this case, priorities tied to associations that refer to policy rules).  Both types of changes are done in such a way that, to the extent possible, interoperability with implementations of the original PCIM model is preserved.  This document updates RFC 3060.

It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+1894">RFC 1894</a>. This memo defines a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type that may be used by a message transfer agent (MTA) or electronic mail gateway to report the result of an attempt to deliver a message to one or more recipients.  This content-type is intended as a machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the so-called "Local Area Network (LAN)-based" systems), the Delivery Status Notification (DSN) protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in Internet mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3464.txt

This document proposes a small modification to the way TCP increases its congestion window.  Rather than the traditional method of increasing the congestion window by a constant amount for each arriving acknowledgment, the document suggests basing the increase on the number of previously unacknowledged bytes each ACK covers.  This change improves the performance of TCP, as well as closes a security hole TCP receivers can use to induce the sender into increasing the sending rate too rapidly.

3469	A			RFCs from 2003							"Framework for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Recovery" was released in February of 2003 by V. Sharma, and F. Hellstrand. Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) integrates the label swapping forwarding paradigm with network layer routing.  To deliver reliable service, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on different paths.  This requires that the label switching routers (LSRs) support fault detection, fault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS signaling support the configuration of recovery.  With these objectives in mind, this document specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery.  Restart issues are not included in this framework.

3478	A			RFCs from 2003							"Graceful Restart Mechanism for Label Distribution Protocol" was released in February of 2003 by R. Aggarwal, Y. Rekhter, and M. Leelanivas. This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the negative effects on MPLS traffic caused by Label Switching Router's (LSR's) control plane restart, specifically by the restart of its Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) component, on LSRs that are capable of preserving the MPLS forwarding component across the restart.  The mechanism described in this document is applicable to all LSRs, both those with the ability to preserve forwarding state during LDP restart and those without (although the latter needs to implement only a subset of the mechanism described in this document).  Supporting (a subset of) the mechanism described here by the LSRs that can not preserve their MPLS forwarding state across the restart would not reduce the negative impact on MPLS traffic caused by their control plane restart, but it would minimize the impact if their neighbor(s) are capable of preserving the forwarding state across the restart of their control plane and implement the mechanism described here.  The mechanism makes minimalistic assumptions on what has to be preserved across restart - the mechanism assumes that only the actual MPLS forwarding state has to be preserved; the mechanism does not require any of the LDP-related states to be preserved across the restart.  The procedures described in this document apply to downstream unsolicited label distribution.  Extending these procedures to downstream on demand label distribution is for further study.

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) systems will be used in core networks where system downtime must be kept to an absolute minimum.  Many MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs) may, therefore, exploit Fault Tolerant (FT) hardware or software to provide high availability of the core networks.  The details of how FT is achieved for the various components of an FT LSR, including Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), the switching hardware and TCP, are implementation specific.  This document identifies issues in the LDP specification in RFC 3036, "LDP Specification", that make it difficult to implement an FT LSR using the current LDP protocols, and defines enhancements to the LDP specification to ease such FT LSR implementations.

3482	A			RFCs from 2003							"Number Portability in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN): An Overview" was released in February of 2003 by M. Foster, J. Yu, and T. McGarry. This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number portability (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).  NP is a regulatory imperative seeking to liberalize local telephony service competition, by enabling end-users to retain telephone numbers while changing service providers.  NP changes the fundamental nature of a dialed E.164 number from a hierarchical physical routing address to a virtual address, thereby requiring the transparent translation of the later to the former.  In addition, there are various regulatory constraints that establish relevant parameters for NP implementation, most of which are not network technology specific.  Consequently, the implementation of NP behavior consistent with applicable regulatory constraints, as well as the need for interoperation with the existing GSTN NP implementations, are relevant topics for numerous areas of IP telephony works-in-progress with the IETF.

3484	A			RFCs from 2003							"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)" was released in February of 2003 by R. Draves. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+6724">RFC 6724</a>. This document describes two algorithms, for source address selection and for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.  They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses - depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.  All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement default address selection as defined in this specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3484.txt

Rosenberg, and C. Huitema. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5389">RFC 5389</a>. Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs) (STUN) is a lightweight protocol that allows applications to discover the presence and types of NATs and firewalls between them and the public Internet.  It also provides the ability for applications to determine the public Internet Protocol (IP) addresses allocated to them by the NAT.  STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.  As a result, it allows a wide variety of applications to work through existing NAT infrastructure.

3490	A			RFCs from 2003							"Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)" was released in March of 2003 by P. Faltstrom, A. Costello, and P. Hoffman. Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use characters outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document defines internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for handling them in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called host names today.  This backward-compatible representation is required in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for processing domain names, not free text. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt

3492	A			RFCs from 2003							"Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)" was released in March of 2003 by A. Costello. Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).  It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string.  ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens).  This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set.  Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt
3493	A			RFCs from 2003							"Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6" was released in February of 2003 by J. McCann, R. Gilligan, J. Bound, W. Stevens, and S. Thomson. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2553">RFC 2553</a>. The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP applications is the "sockets" interface.  Although this API was developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented on a wide variety of non-Unix systems.  TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6 applications.  But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes these changes.  These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket options.  These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.  Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document.

The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.  IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244.  IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501.txt

This document describes the representation of a session authorization policy element for supporting policy-based per-session authorization and admission control.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to co-ordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes.  This document describes how a process on a system authorizes the reservation of resources by a host and then provides that host with a session authorization policy element which can be inserted into a resource reservation protocol (e.g., the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) PATH message) to facilitate proper and secure reservation of those resources within the network.  We describe the encoding of session authorization information as a policy element conforming to the format of a Policy Data object (RFC 2750) and provide details relating to operations, processing rules and error scenarios.

3521	A			RFCs from 2003							"Framework for Session Set-up with Media Authorization" was released in April of 2003 by L-N. Hamer, B. Gage, and H. Shieh. Establishing multimedia streams must take into account requirements for end-to-end QoS, authorization of network resource usage and accurate accounting for resources used.  During session set up, policies may be enforced to ensure that the media streams being requested lie within the bounds of the service profile established for the requesting host.  Similarly, when a host requests resources to provide a certain QoS for a packet flow, policies may be enforced to ensure that the required resources lie within the bounds of the resource profile established for the requesting host.  To prevent fraud and to ensure accurate billing, this document describes various scenarios and mechanisms that provide the linkage required to verify that the resources being used to provide a requested QoS are in- line with the media streams requested (and authorized) for the session.

3522	A			RFCs from 2003							"The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP" was released in April of 2003 by R. Ludwig, and M. Meyer. The Eifel detection algorithm allows a TCP sender to detect a posteriori whether it has entered loss recovery unnecessarily.  It requires that the TCP Timestamps option defined in RFC 1323 be enabled for a connection.  The Eifel detection algorithm makes use of the fact that the TCP Timestamps option eliminates the retransmission ambiguity in TCP.  Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable ACK that arrives during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered unnecessarily.  The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for future TCP enhancements.  This includes response algorithms to back out of loss recovery by restoring a TCP sender's congestion control state.

This document describes the link selection sub-option of the relay- agent-information option for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4).  The giaddr specifies an IP address which determines both a subnet, and thereby a link on which a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client resides as well as an IP address that can be used to communicate with the relay agent.  The subnet-selection option allows the functions of the giaddr to be split so that when one entity is performing as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the subnet/link from which to allocate an IP address, which is different from the IP address with which it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.  Analogous situations exist where the relay agent needs to specify the subnet/link on which a DHCP client resides, which is different from an IP address that can be used to communicate with the relay agent.

3531	A			RFCs from 2003							"A Flexible Method for Managing the Assignment of Bits of an IPv6 Address Block" was released in April of 2003 by M. Blanchet. This document proposes a method to manage the assignment of bits of an IPv6 address block or range.  When an organisation needs to make an address plan for its subnets or when an ISP needs to make an address plan for its customers, this method enables the organisation to postpone the final decision on the number of bits to partition in the address space they have.  It does it by keeping the bits around the borders of the partition to be free as long as possible.  This scheme is applicable to any bits addressing scheme using bits with partitions in the space, but its first intended use is for IPv6.  It is a generalization of RFC 1219 and can be used for IPv6 assignments.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3531.txt

Geevarghese. This document describes a header compression scheme for point to point links with packet loss and long delays.  It is based on Compressed Real-time Transport Protocol (CRTP), the IP/UDP/RTP header compression described in RFC 2508.  CRTP does not perform well on such links: packet loss results in context corruption and due to the long delay, many more packets are discarded before the context is repaired.  To correct the behavior of CRTP over such links, a few extensions to the protocol are specified here.  The extensions aim to reduce context corruption by changing the way the compressor updates the context at the decompressor: updates are repeated and include updates to full and differential context parameters.  With these extensions, CRTP performs well over links with packet loss, packet reordering and long delays. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3545.txt

3550	A			RFCs from 2003							"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications" was released in July of 2003 by V. Jacobson, S. Casner, H. Schulzrinne, and R. Frederick. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+1889">RFC 1889</a>. This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

This document describes a profile called "RTP/AVP" for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control.  It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences.  In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings.  This document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP.  It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP.  The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards.  This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications.  This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890.  It is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found.

3566	A			RFCs from 2003							"The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec" was released in September of 2003 by S. Frankel, and H. Herbert. A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash function.  One popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a block cipher in conjunction with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode of operation.  The classic CBC-MAC algorithm, while secure for messages of a pre-selected fixed length, has been shown to be insecure across messages of varying lengths such as the type found in typical IP datagrams.  This memo specifies the use of AES in CBC mode with a set of extensions to overcome this limitation.  This new algorithm is named AES-XCBC-MAC-96.

3573	A			RFCs from 2003							"Signalling of Modem-On-Hold status in Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)" was released in July of 2003 by I. Goyret. The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines a mechanism for tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) sessions.  It is common for these PPP sessions to be established using modems connected over the public switched telephone network.  One of the standards governing modem operation defines procedures that enable a client modem to put the call on hold and later, re-establish the modem link with minimal delay and without having to redial.  While the modem call is on hold, the client phone line can be used to place or receive other calls.  The L2TP base protocol does not provide any means to signal these events from the L2TP Access Controller (LAC), where the modem is physically connected, to the L2TP Network Server (LNS), where the PPP session is handled.  This document describes a method to let the LNS know when a client modem connected to a LAC has placed the call on hold. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3573.txt

3579	A			RFCs from 2003							"RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) Support For Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)" was released in September of 2003 by P. Calhoun, and B. Aboba. This document defines Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) support for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication mechanisms.  In the proposed scheme, the Network Access Server (NAS) forwards EAP packets to and from the RADIUS server, encapsulated within EAP-Message attributes.  This has the advantage of allowing the NAS to support any EAP authentication method, without the need for method- specific code, which resides on the RADIUS server.  While EAP was originally developed for use with PPP, it is now also in use with IEEE 802.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3579.txt

3581	A			RFCs from 2003							"An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Symmetric Response Routing" was released in August of 2003 by J. Rosenberg, and H. Schulzrinne. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP, among others.  When used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the source address the request came from, and to the port written into the topmost Via header field value of the request.  This behavior is not desirable in many cases, most notably, when the client is behind a Network Address Translator (NAT).  This extension defines a new parameter for the Via header field, called "rport", that allows a client to request that the server send the response back to the source IP address and port from which the request originated.

3585	A			RFCs from 2003							"IPsec Configuration Policy Information Model" was released in August of 2003 by J. Jason, L. Rafalow, and E. Vyncke. This document presents an object-oriented information model of IP Security (IPsec) policy designed to facilitate agreement about the content and semantics of IPsec policy, and enable derivations of task- specific representations of IPsec policy such as storage schema, distribution representations, and policy specification languages used to configure IPsec-enabled endpoints.  The information model described in this document models the configuration parameters defined by IPSec.  The information model also covers the parameters found by the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE).  Other key exchange protocols could easily be added to the information model by a simple extension.  Further extensions can further be added easily due to the object-oriented nature of the model.  This information model is based upon the core policy classes as defined in the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and in the Policy Core Information Model Extensions (PCIMe).

3609	A			RFCs from 2003							"Tracing Requirements for Generic Tunnels" was released in September of 2003 by K. Kompella, D. Meyer, and R. Bonica. This document specifies requirements for a generic route-tracing application.  It also specifies requirements for a protocol that will support that application.  Network operators will use the generic route-tracing application to verify proper operation of the IP forwarding plane.  They will also use the application to discover details regarding tunnels that support IP forwarding.  The generic route-tracing application, specified herein, supports a superset of the functionality that "traceroute" currently offers.  Like traceroute, the generic route-tracing application can discover the forwarding path between two interfaces that are contained by an IP network.  Unlike traceroute, this application can reveal details regarding tunnels that support the IP forwarding path.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3609.txt

3611	A			RFCs from 2003							"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)" was released in November of 2003 by T. Friedman, R. Caceres, and A. Clark. This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  XR packets are composed of report blocks, and seven block types are defined here.  The purpose of the extended reporting format is to convey information that supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets.  Some applications, such as multicast inference of network characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require other and more detailed statistics.  In addition to the block types defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future by adhering to the framework that this document provides.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3611.txt

3623	A			RFCs from 2003							"Graceful OSPF Restart" was released in November of 2003 by A. Lindem, P. Pillay-Esnault, and J. Moy. This memo documents an enhancement to the OSPF routing protocol, whereby an OSPF router can stay on the forwarding path even as its OSPF software is restarted.  This is called "graceful restart" or "non-stop forwarding".  A restarting router may not be capable of adjusting its forwarding in a timely manner when the network topology changes.  In order to avoid the possible resulting routing loops, the procedure in this memo automatically reverts to a normal OSPF restart when such a topology change is detected, or when one or more of the restarting router's neighbors do not support the enhancements in this memo.  Proper network operation during a graceful restart makes assumptions upon the operating environment of the restarting router; these assumptions are also documented.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3623.txt
3624	A			RFCs from 2003							"The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Bulk Audit Package" was released in November of 2003 by F. Andreasen, D. Auerbach, and B. Foster.

This document describes a new MGCP package for bulk auditing of a group of gateway endpoints.  It allows a Call Agent to determine the endpoint naming convention, the list of instantiated endpoints as well connection and endpoint state for the group of endpoints.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3624.txt
3625	A			RFCs from 2003							"The QCP File Format and Media Types for Speech Data" was released in September of 2003 by H. Garudadri, and R. Gellens. RFC 2658 specifies the streaming format for 3GPP2 13KK vocoder (High Rate Speech Service Option 17 for Wideband Spread Spectrum Communications Systems, also known as QCELP 13K vocoder) data, but does not specify a storage format.  Many implementations have been using the "QCP" file format (named for its file extension) for exchanging QCELP 13K data as well as Enhanced Variable Rate Coder (EVRC) and Selectable Mode Vocoders (SMV) data. (For example, Eudora(r), QuickTime(r), and cmda2000(r) handsets).  This document specifies the QCP file format and updates the audio/qcelp media registration to specify this format for storage, and registers the audio/evrc-qcp and audio/smv-qcp media types for EVRC and SMV (respectively) data stored in this format.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3625.txt
3626	A			RFCs from 2003							"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)" was released in October of 2003 by P. Jacquet, and T. Clausen. This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN.  The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs).  MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process.  This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message.  In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs.  Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network.  As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors.  Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network.  This information is then used for route calculation.  OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops).  The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3626.txt
3627	A			RFCs from 2003							"Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful" was released in September of 2003 by P. Savola. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+6547">RFC 6547</a>. In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127 prefix lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers.  Under certain situations, this may lead to one router claiming both addresses due to subnet-router anycast being implemented.  This document discusses the issue and offers a couple of solutions to the problem; nevertheless, /127 should be avoided between two routers.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3627.txt
3628	A			RFCs from 2003							"Policy Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities (TSAs)" was released in November of 2003 by N. Pope, D. Pinkas, and J. Ross.

3629	A			RFCs from 2003							"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646" was released in November of 2003 by F. Yergeau. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2279">RFC 2279</a>. ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8, the object of this memo.  UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.  This memo obsoletes and replaces RFC 2279.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3629.txt
3630	A			RFCs from 2003							"Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2" was released in September of 2003 by K. Kompella, D. Yeung, and D. Katz.

3631	A			RFCs from 2003							"Security Mechanisms for the Internet" was released in December of 2003 by C. Kaufman, S. Bellovin, and J. Schiller. Security must be built into Internet Protocols for those protocols to offer their services securely.  Many security problems can be traced to improper implementations.  However, even a proper implementation will have security problems if the fundamental protocol is itself exploitable.  Exactly how security should be implemented in a protocol will vary, because of the structure of the protocol itself.  However, there are many protocols for which standard Internet security mechanisms, already developed, may be applicable.  The precise one that is appropriate in any given situation can vary.  We review a number of different choices, explaining the properties of each.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3631.txt

3648	A			RFCs from 2003							"Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Ordered Collections Protocol" was released in December of 2003 by J. Whitehead, and J. Reschke. This specification extends the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Protocol to support the server-side ordering of collection members.  Of particular interest are orderings that are not based on property values, and so cannot be achieved using a search protocol's ordering option and cannot be maintained automatically by the server.  Protocol elements are defined to let clients specify the position in the ordering of each collection member, as well as the semantics governing the ordering.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3648.txt
3649	A			RFCs from 2003							"HighSpeed TCP for Large Congestion Windows" was released in December of 2003 by S. Floyd. The proposals in this document are experimental.  While they may be deployed in the current Internet, they do not represent a consensus that this is the best method for high-speed congestion control.  In particular, we note that alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative proposals.  This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments.  For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours).  This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint.  To address his limitation of TCP, this document proposes HighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation and feedback from the wider community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3649.txt

It also defines the messages exchanged between the client and server for any handle operation.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3652.txt
3653	A			RFCs from 2003							"XML-Signature XPath Filter 2.0" was released in December of 2003 by J. Reagle, M. Hughes, and J. Boyer. XML Signature recommends a standard means for specifying information content to be digitally signed and for representing the resulting digital signatures in XML.  Some applications require the ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information content to be signed.  The XML Signature specification meets this requirement with the XPath transform.  However, this transform can be difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies.  This specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the development of efficient document subsetting implementations that interoperate under similar performance profiles.  This document is the W3C XML Signature XPath-Filter 2.0 Recommendation.  This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested parties and has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation.  It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another document.  W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment.  This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3653.txt

3655	A			RFCs from 2003							"Redefinition of DNS Authenticated Data (AD) bit" was released in November of 2003 by O. Gudmundsson, and B. Wellington. This document alters the specification defined in RFC 2535.  Based on implementation experience, the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the DNS header is not useful.  This document redefines the AD bit such that it is only set if all answers or records proving that no answers exist in the response has been cryptographically verified or otherwise meets the server's local security policy.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3655.txt
3656	A			RFCs from 2003							"The Mailbox Update (MUPDATE) Distributed Mailbox Database Protocol" was released in December of 2003 by R. Siemborski. As the demand for high-performance mail delivery agents increases, it becomes apparent that single-machine solutions are inadequate to the task, both because of capacity limits and that the failure of the single machine means a loss of mail delivery for all users.  It is preferable to allow many machines to share the responsibility of mail delivery.  The Mailbox Update (MUPDATE) protocol allows a group of Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) servers to function with a unified mailbox namespace.  This document is intended to serve as a reference guide to that protocol.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3656.txt
3657	A			RFCs from 2004							"Use of the Camellia Encryption Algorithm in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)" was released in January of 2004 by S. Moriai, and A. Kato. This document specifies the conventions for using the Camellia encryption algorithm for encryption with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3657.txt
3658	A			RFCs from 2003							"Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record (RR)" was released in December of 2003 by O. Gudmundsson. The delegation signer (DS) resource record (RR) is inserted at a zone cut (i.e., a delegation point) to indicate that the delegated zone is digitally signed and that the delegated zone recognizes the indicated key as a valid zone key for the delegated zone.  The DS RR is a modification to the DNS Security Extensions definition, motivated by operational considerations.  The intent is to use this resource record as an explicit statement about the delegation, rather than relying on inference.  This document defines the DS RR, gives examples of how it is used and describes the implications on resolvers.  This change is not backwards compatible with RFC 2535.  This document updates RFC 1035, RFC 2535, RFC 3008 and RFC 3090.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3658.txt
3659	A			RFCs from 2007							"Extensions to FTP" was released in March of 2007 by P. Hethmon. This document specifies new FTP commands to obtain listings of remote directories in a defined format, and to permit restarts of interrupted data transfers in STREAM mode.  It allows character sets other than US-ASCII, and also defines an optional virtual file storage structure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3659.txt
3660	A			RFCs from 2003							"Basic Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Packages" was released in December of 2003 by F. Andreasen, and B. Foster. This document provides a basic set of Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) packages.  The generic, line, trunk, handset, RTP, DTMF (Dual Tone Multifrequency), announcement server and script packages are updates of packages from RFC 2705 with additional explanation and in some cases new versions of these packages.  In addition to these, five new packages are defined here.  These are the signal list, resource reservation, media format, supplementary services and digit map extension packages.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3660.txt
3661	A			RFCs from 2003							"Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Return Code Usage" was released in December of 2003 by B. Foster, and C. Sivachelvan. This document provides implementation guidelines for the use of return codes in RFC 3435, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Version 1.0.  Return codes in RFC 3435 do not cover all possible specific situations that may ever occur in a gateway.  That is not possible and not necessary.  What is important is to ensure that the Call Agent that receives a return code behaves appropriately and consistently for the given situation.  The purpose of this document is to provide implementation guidelines to ensure that consistency.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3661.txt
3662	A			RFCs from 2003							"A Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (PDB) for Differentiated Services" was released in December of 2003 by K. Nichols, R. Bless, and K. Wehrle. This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior (PDB) whose traffic may be "starved" (although starvation is not strictly required) in a properly functioning network.  This is in contrast to the Internet's "best-effort" or "normal Internet traffic" model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a "lower" priority than the normal "best-effort" Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called "Lower Effort" (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on "best-effort"/"normal" or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3662.txt
3663	A			RFCs from 2003							"Domain Administrative Data in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)" was released in December of 2003 by A. Newton. Domain registration data has typically been exposed to the general public via Nicname/Whois for administrative purposes.

3666	A			RFCs from 2003							"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Call Flows" was released in December of 2003 by R. Sparks, C. Cunningham, S. Donovan, K. Summers, and A. Johnston. This document contains best current practice examples of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) call flows showing interworking with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).  Elements in these call flows include SIP User Agents, SIP Proxy Servers, and PSTN Gateways.  Scenarios include SIP to PSTN, PSTN to SIP, and PSTN to PSTN via SIP.  PSTN telephony protocols are illustrated using ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), ISUP (ISDN User Part), and FGB (Feature Group B) circuit associated signaling.  PSTN calls are illustrated using global telephone numbers from the PSTN and private extensions served on by a PBX (Private Branch Exchange).  Call flow diagrams and message details are shown.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3666.txt

3668	A			RFCs from 2004							"Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology" was released in February of 2004 by S. Bradner. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+3979">RFC 3979</a>. The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible.  The policies are also intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 3667, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This memo also updates paragraph 4 of Section 3.2 of RFC 2028, for all purposes, including reference [2] in RFC 2418.

3670	A			RFCs from 2004							"Information Model for Describing Network Device QoS Datapath Mechanisms" was released in January of 2004 by D. Durham, B. Moore, J. Strassner, A. Westerinen, and W. Weiss. The purpose of this document is to define an information model to describe the quality of service (QoS) mechanisms inherent in different network devices, including hosts.  Broadly speaking, these mechanisms describe the properties common to selecting and conditioning traffic through the forwarding path (datapath) of a network device.  This selection and conditioning of traffic in the datapath spans both major QoS architectures: Differentiated Services and Integrated Services.  This document should be used with the QoS Policy Information Model (QPIM) to model how policies can be defined to manage and configure the QoS mechanisms (i.e., the classification, marking, metering, dropping, queuing, and scheduling functionality) of devices.  Together, these two documents describe how to write QoS policy rules to configure and manage the QoS mechanisms present in the datapaths of devices.  This document, as well as QPIM, are information models.  That is, they represent information independent of a binding to a specific type of repository	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3670.txt
3671	A			RFCs from 2003							"Collective Attributes in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)" was released in December of 2003 by K. Zeilenga. X.500 collective attributes allow common characteristics to be shared between collections of entries.  This document summarizes the X.500 information model for collective attributes and describes use of collective attributes in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).  This document provides schema definitions for collective attributes for use in LDAP.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3671.txt
3672	A			RFCs from 2003							"Subentries in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)" was released in December of 2003 by K. Zeilenga. In X.500 directories, subentries are special entries used to hold information associated with a subtree or subtree refinement.  This document adapts X.500 subentries mechanisms for use with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3672.txt
3673	A			RFCs from 2003							"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAPv3): All Operational Attributes" was released in December of 2003 by K. Zeilenga. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) supports a mechanism for requesting the return of all user attributes but not all operational attributes.  This document describes an LDAP extension which clients may use to request the return of all operational attributes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3673.txt
3674	A			RFCs from 2003							"Feature Discovery in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)" was released in December of 2003 by K. Zeilenga. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+4512">RFC 4512</a>. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an extensible protocol with numerous elective features.  This document introduces a general mechanism for discovery of elective features and extensions which cannot be discovered using existing mechanisms.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3674.txt
3675	A			RFCs from 2004							".sex Considered Dangerous" was released in February of 2004 by D. Eastlake 3rd. Periodically there are proposals to mandate the use of a special top level name or an IP address bit to flag "adult" or "unsafe" material or the like.  This document explains why this is an ill considered idea from the legal, philosophical, and particularly, the technical points of view.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3675.txt
3676	A			RFCs from 2004							"The Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters" was released in February of 2004 by R. Gellens. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2646">RFC 2646</a>. This specification establishes two parameters (Format and DelSP) to be used with the Text/Plain media type.  In the presence of these parameters, trailing whitespace is used to indicate flowed lines and a canonical quote indicator is used to indicate quoted lines.  This results in an encoding which appears as normal Text/Plain in older implementations, since it is in fact normal Text/Plain, yet provides for superior wrapping/flowing, and quoting.  This document supersedes the one specified in RFC 2646, "The Text/Plain Format Parameter", and adds the DelSp parameter to accommodate languages/coded character sets in which ASCII spaces are not used or appear rarely.

3677	A			RFCs from 2003							"IETF ISOC Board of Trustee Appointment Procedures" was released in December of 2003 by Internet Architecture Board, and L. Daigle. This memo outlines the process by which the IETF makes a selection of an Internet Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees appointment.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3677.txt
3678	A			RFCs from 2004							"Socket Interface Extensions for Multicast Source Filters" was released in January of 2004 by D. Thaler, B. Quinn, and B. Fenner. The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMPv3) for IPv4 and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2) for IPv6 add the capability for applications to express source filters on multicast group memberships, which allows receiver applications to determine the set of senders (sources) from which to accept multicast traffic.  This capability also simplifies support of one-to-many type multicast applications.  This document specifies new socket options and functions to manage source filters for IP Multicast group memberships.  It also defines the socket structures to provide input and output arguments to these new application program interfaces (APIs).  These extensions are designed to provide access to the source filtering features, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing multicast applications.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3678.txt
3679	A			RFCs from 2004							"Unused Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option Codes" was released in January of 2004 by R. Droms. Prior to the publication of RFC 2489 (which was updated by RFC 2939), several option codes were assigned to proposed Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options that were subsequently never used.  This document lists those unused option codes and directs IANA to make these option codes available for assignment to other DHCP options in the future.  The document also lists several option codes that are not currently documented in an RFC but should not be made available for reassignment to future DHCP options.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3679.txt
3680	A			RFCs from 2004							"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Registrations" was released in March of 2004 by J. Rosenberg. This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package for registrations.  Through its REGISTER method, SIP allows a user agent to create, modify, and delete registrations.  Registrations can also be altered by administrators in order to enforce policy.  As a result, these registrations represent a piece of state in the network that can change dynamically.  There are many cases where a user agent would like to be notified of changes in this state.  This event package defines a mechanism by which those user agents can request and obtain such notifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3680.txt
3681	A			RFCs from 2004							"Delegation of E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA" was released in January of 2004 by R. Bush, and R. Fink. This document discusses the need for delegation of the E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA DNS zone in order to enable reverse lookups for 6bone addresses, and makes specific recommendations for the process needed to accomplish this.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3681.txt
3682	A			RFCs from 2004							"The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)" was released in February of 2004 by V. Gill, J. Heasley, and D. Meyer. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5082">RFC 5082</a>. The use of a packet's Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) to protect a protocol stack from CPU-utilization based attacks has been proposed in many settings (see for example, RFC 2461).  This document generalizes these techniques for use by other protocols such as BGP (RFC 1771), Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP), Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) (RFC 3036).  While the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) is most effective in protecting directly connected protocol peers, it can also provide a lower level of protection to multi-hop sessions.  GTSM is not directly applicable to protocols employing flooding mechanisms (e.g., multicast), and use of multi-hop GTSM should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3682.txt
3683	A			RFCs from 2004							"A Practice for Revoking Posting Rights to IETF Mailing Lists" was released in March of 2004 by M. Rose. All self-governing bodies have ways of managing the scope of participant interaction.  The IETF uses a consensus-driven process for developing computer-communications standards in an open fashion.  An important part of this consensus-driven process is the pervasive use of mailing lists for discussion.  Notably, in a small number of cases, a participant has engaged in a "denial-of-service" attack to disrupt the consensus-driven process.  Regrettably, as these bad faith attacks become more common, the IETF needs to establish a practice that reduces or eliminates these attacks.  This memo recommends such a practice for use by the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3683.txt
3684	A			RFCs from 2004							"Topology Dissemination Based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF)" was released in February of 2004 by F. Templin, M. Lewis, and R. Ogier. Topology Dissemination Based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is a proactive, link-state routing protocol designed for mobile ad-hoc networks, which provides hop-by-hop routing along shortest paths to each destination.  Each node running TBRPF computes a source tree (providing paths to all reachable nodes) based on partial topology information stored in its topology table, using a modification of Dijkstra's algorithm.  To minimize overhead, each node reports only *part* of its source tree to neighbors.  TBRPF uses a combination of periodic and differential updates to keep all neighbors informed of the reported part of its source tree.  Each node also has the option to report additional topology information (up to the full topology), to provide improved robustness in highly mobile networks.  TBRPF performs neighbor discovery using "differential" HELLO messages which report only *changes* in the status of neighbors.  This results in HELLO messages that are much smaller than those of other link-state routing protocols such as OSPF.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3684.txt
3685	A			RFCs from 2004							"SIEVE Email Filtering: Spamtest and VirusTest Extensions" was released in February of 2004 by C. Daboo. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5235">RFC 5235</a>. The SIEVE mail filtering language "spamtest" and "virustest" extensions permit users to use simple, portable commands for spam and virus tests on email messages.  Each extension provides a new test using matches against numeric 'scores'.  It is the responsibility of the underlying SIEVE implementation to do the actual checks that result in values returned by the tests. [PROPOSED STANDARD]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3685.txt
3686	A			RFCs from 2004							"Using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Counter Mode With IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)" was released in January of 2004 by R. Housley. This document describes the use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Counter Mode, with an explicit initialization vector, as an IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) confidentiality mechanism.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3686.txt
3687	A			RFCs from 2004							"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500 Component Matching Rules" was released in February of 2004 by S. Legg. The syntaxes of attributes in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or X.500 directory range from simple data types, such as text string, integer, or boolean, to complex structured data types, such as the syntaxes of the directory schema operational attributes.  Matching rules defined for the complex syntaxes usually only provide the most immediately useful matching capability.  This document defines generic matching rules that can match any user selected component parts in an attribute value of any arbitrarily complex attribute syntax.

3691	A			RFCs from 2004							"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) UNSELECT command" was released in February of 2004 by A. Melnikov. This document defines an UNSELECT command that can be used to close the current mailbox in an Internet Message Access Protocol - version 4 (IMAP4) session without expunging it.  Certain types of IMAP clients need to release resources associated with the selected mailbox without selecting a different mailbox.  While IMAP4 provides this functionality (via a SELECT command with a nonexistent mailbox name or reselecting the same mailbox with EXAMINE command), a more clean solution is desirable.

3692	A			RFCs from 2004							"Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful" was released in January of 2004 by T. Narten. When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a closed environment.  For example, to test a new DHCP option, one needs an option number to identify the new function.  This document recommends that when writing IANA Considerations sections, authors should consider assigning a small range of numbers for experimentation purposes that implementers can use when testing protocol extensions or other new features.  This document reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to support experimentation has been identified.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3692.txt
3693	A			RFCs from 2004							"Geopriv Requirements" was released in February of 2004 by J. Peterson, D. Mulligan, J. Cuellar, J. Polk, and J. Morris. Location-based services, navigation applications, emergency services, management of equipment in the field, and other location-dependent services need geographic location information about a Target (such as a user, resource or other entity).  There is a need to securely gather and transfer location information for location services, while at the same time protect the privacy of the individuals involved.  This document focuses on the authorization, security and privacy requirements for such location-dependent services.  Specifically, it describes the requirements for the Geopriv Location Object (LO) and for the protocols that use this Location Object.  This LO is envisioned to be the primary data structure used in all Geopriv protocol exchanges to securely transfer location data.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3693.txt
3694	A			RFCs from 2004							"Threat Analysis of the Geopriv Protocol" was released in February of 2004 by J. Peterson, D. Mulligan, M. Danley, and J. Morris. This document provides some analysis of threats against the Geopriv protocol architecture.  It focuses on protocol threats, threats that result from the storage of data by entities in the architecture, and threats posed by the abuse of information yielded by Geopriv.  Some security properties that meet these threats are enumerated as a reference for Geopriv requirements.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3694.txt
3695	A			RFCs from 2004							"Compact Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes" was released in February of 2004 by L. Vicisano, and M. Luby. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5445">RFC 5445</a>. This document introduces some Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes that supplement the FEC schemes described in RFC 3452.  The primary benefits of these additional FEC schemes are that they are designed for reliable bulk delivery of large objects using a more compact FEC Payload ID, and they can be used to sequentially deliver blocks of an object of indeterminate length.  Thus, they more flexibly support different delivery models with less packet header overhead.  This document also describes the Fully-Specified FEC scheme corresponding to FEC Encoding ID 0.  This Fully-Specified FEC scheme requires no FEC coding and is introduced primarily to allow simple interoperability testing between different implementations of protocol instantiations that use the FEC building block.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3695.txt
3696	A			RFCs from 2004							"Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names" was released in February of 2004 by J. Klensin. Many Internet applications have been designed to deduce top-level domains (or other domain name labels) from partial information.  The introduction of new top-level domains, especially non-country-code ones, has exposed flaws in some of the methods used by these applications.  These flaws make it more difficult, or impossible, for users of the applications to access the full Internet.  This memo discusses some of the techniques that have been used and gives some guidance for minimizing their negative impact as the domain name environment evolves.  This document draws summaries of the applicable rules together in one place and supplies references to the actual standards.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3696.txt

This document specifies the IPv6 Flow Label field and the minimum requirements for IPv6 source nodes labeling flows, IPv6 nodes forwarding labeled packets, and flow state establishment methods.  Even when mentioned as examples of possible uses of the flow labeling, more detailed requirements for specific use cases are out of scope for this document.  The usage of the Flow Label field enables efficient IPv6 flow classification based only on IPv6 main header fields in fixed positions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3697.txt

3701	A			RFCs from 2004							"6bone (IPv6 Testing Address Allocation) Phaseout" was released in March of 2004 by R. Hinden, and R. Fink. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2471">RFC 2471</a>. The 6bone was established in 1996 by the IETF as an IPv6 Testbed network to enable various IPv6 testing as well as to assist in the transitioning of IPv6 into the Internet.  It operates under the IPv6 address allocation 3FFE::/16 from RFC 2471.  As IPv6 is beginning its production deployment it is appropriate to plan for the phaseout of the 6bone.  This document establishes a plan for a multi-year phaseout of the 6bone and its address allocation on the assumption that the IETF is the appropriate place to determine this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2471, "IPv6 Testing Address Allocation", December, 1998.  RFC 2471 will become historic.

3703	A			RFCs from 2004							"Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema" was released in February of 2004 by B. Moore, J. Strassner, R. Moats, and E. Ellesson. This document defines a mapping of the Policy Core Information Model to a form that can be implemented in a directory that uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as its access protocol.  This model defines two hierarchies of object classes: structural classes representing information for representing and controlling policy data as specified in RFC 3060, and relationship classes that indicate how instances of the structural classes are related to each other.  Classes are also added to the LDAP schema to improve the performance of a client's interactions with an LDAP server when the client is retrieving large amounts of policy-related information.  These classes exist only to optimize LDAP retrievals: there are no classes in the information model that correspond to them. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3703.txt
3704	A			RFCs from 2004							"Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks" was released in March of 2004 by F. Baker, and P. Savola. BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed denial of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access to the network, and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct source network.  As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment.  There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming.  This document describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular.  This memo updates RFC 2827.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3704.txt

3714	A			RFCs from 2004							"IAB Concerns Regarding Congestion Control for Voice Traffic in the Internet" was released in March of 2004 by J. Kempf, and S. Floyd. This document discusses IAB concerns about effective end-to-end congestion control for best-effort voice traffic in the Internet.  These concerns have to do with fairness, user quality, and with the dangers of congestion collapse.  The concerns are particularly relevant in light of the absence of a widespread Quality of Service (QoS) deployment in the Internet, and the likelihood that this situation will not change much in the near term.  This document is not making any recommendations about deployment paths for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in terms of QoS support, and is not claiming that best-effort service can be relied upon to give acceptable performance for VoIP.  We are merely observing that voice traffic is occasionally deployed as best-effort traffic over some links in the Internet, that we expect this occasional deployment to continue, and that we have concerns about the lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for this best-effort voice traffic.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3714.txt
3715	A			RFCs from 2004							"IPsec-Network Address Translation (NAT) Compatibility Requirements" was released in March of 2004 by W. Dixon, and B. Aboba. This document describes known incompatibilities between Network Address Translation (NAT) and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressing them.  Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private networking capabilities.  One very popular use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) is to provide telecommuter access to the corporate Intranet.  Today, NATs are widely deployed in home gateways, as well as in other locations likely to be used by telecommuters, such as hotels.  The result is that IPsec-NAT incompatibilities have become a major barrier in the deployment of IPsec in one of its principal uses.

3720	A			RFCs from 2004							"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)" was released in April of 2004 by M. Chadalapaka, K. Meth, E. Zeidner, C. Sapuntzakis, and J. Satran. This document describes a transport protocol for Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) that works on top of TCP.  The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized SCSI architecture model.  SCSI is a popular family of protocols that enable systems to communicate with I/O devices, especially storage devices.  SCSI protocols are request/response application protocols with a common standardized architecture model and basic command set, as well as standardized command sets for different device classes (disks, tapes, media-changers etc.).  As system interconnects move from the classical bus structure to a network structure, SCSI has to be mapped to network transport protocols.  IP networks now meet the performance requirements of fast system interconnects and as such are good candidates to "carry" SCSI. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3720.txt

3726	A			RFCs from 2004							"Requirements for Signaling Protocols" was released in April of 2004 by M. Brunner. This document defines requirements for signaling across different network environments, such as across administrative and/or technology domains.  Signaling is mainly considered for Quality of Service (Qos) such as the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).  However, in recent years, several other applications of signaling have been defined.  For example, signaling for label distribution in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) or signaling to middleboxes.  To achieve wide applicability of the requirements, the starting point is a diverse set of scenarios/use cases concerning various types of networks and application interactions.  This document presents the assumptions before listing the requirements.  The requirements are grouped according to areas such as architecture and design goals, signaling flows, layering, performance, flexibility, security, and mobility.

3738	A			RFCs from 2004							"Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC) Building Block" was released in April of 2004 by V. Goyal, and M. Luby. This document specifies Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC), which provides rate and congestion control for data delivery.  WEBRC is specifically designed to support protocols using IP multicast.  It provides multiple-rate, congestion-controlled delivery to receivers, i.e., different receivers joined to the same session may be receiving packets at different rates depending on the bandwidths of their individual connections to the sender and on competing traffic along these connections.  WEBRC requires no feedback from receivers to the sender, i.e., it is a completely receiver-driven congestion control protocol.  Thus, it is designed to scale to potentially massive numbers of receivers attached to a session from a single sender.  Furthermore, because each individual receiver adjusts to the available bandwidth between the sender and that receiver, there is the potential to deliver data to each individual receiver at the fastest possible rate for that receiver, even in a highly heterogeneous network architecture, using a single sender.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3738.txt
3739	A			RFCs from 2004							"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure: Qualified Certificates Profile" was released in March of 2004 by M. Nystrom, S. Santesson, and T. Polk. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+3039">RFC 3039</a>. This document forms a certificate profile, based on RFC 3280, for identity certificates issued to natural persons.  The profile defines specific conventions for certificates that are qualified within a defined legal framework, named Qualified Certificates.  However, the profile does not define any legal requirements for such Qualified Certificates.  The goal of this document is to define a certificate profile that supports the issuance of Qualified Certificates independent of local legal requirements.

3741	A			RFCs from 2004							"Exclusive XML Canonicalization, Version 1.0" was released in March of 2004 by J. Reagle, D. Eastlake 3rd, and J. Boyer. Canonical XML specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the "xml:" namespace.  However, some applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from a canonicalized subdocument.  For example, one might require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will not break when that subdocument is removed from its original message and/or inserted into a different context.  This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3741.txt
3742	A			RFCs from 2004							"Limited Slow-Start for TCP with Large Congestion Windows" was released in March of 2004 by S. Floyd. This document describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  For TCP connections that are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or tens of thousands) of MSS-sized segments (for MSS the sender's MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start procedure can result in increasing the congestion window by thousands of segments in a single round-trip time.  Such an increase can easily result in thousands of packets being dropped in one round-trip time.  This is often counter-productive for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of the traffic sharing the congested link.  This note describes Limited Slow-Start as an optional mechanism for limiting the number of segments by which the congestion window is increased for one window of data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for TCP connections with large congestion windows.

3743	A			RFCs from 2004							"Joint Engineering Team (JET) Guidelines for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) Registration and Administration for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean" was released in April of 2004 by H. Qian, Y. Ko, K. Huang, and K. Konishi. Achieving internationalized access to domain names raises many complex issues.  These are associated not only with basic protocol design, such as how names are represented on the network, compared, and converted to appropriate forms, but also with issues and options for deployment, transition, registration, and administration.  The IETF Standards for Internationalized Domain Names, known as "IDNA", focuses on access to domain names in a range of scripts that is broader in scope than the original ASCII.  The development process made it clear that use of characters with similar appearances and/or interpretations created potential for confusion, as well as difficulties in deployment and transition.  The conclusion was that, while those issues were important, they could best be addressed administratively rather than through restrictions embedded in the protocols.  This document defines a set of guidelines for applying restrictions of that type for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) scripts and the zones that use them and, perhaps, the beginning of a framework for thinking about other zones, languages, and scripts.

3744	A			RFCs from 2004							"Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Access Control Protocol" was released in May of 2004 by E. Sedlar, J. Whitehead, J. Reschke, and G. Clemm. This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol.  This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal.  A lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a wide range of user management repositories.  Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of principals using human names. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3744.txt

3748	A			RFCs from 2004							"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)" was released in June of 2004 by B. Aboba, J. Vollbrecht, L. Blunk, H. Levkowetz, and J. Carlson. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2284">RFC 2284</a>. This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication methods.  EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.  A summary of the changes between this document and RFC 2284 is available in Appendix A. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3748.txt

3750	A			RFCs from 2004							"Unmanaged Networks IPv6 Transition Scenarios" was released in April of 2004 by R. van der Pol, S. Satapati, R. Austein, and C. Huitema. This document defines the scenarios in which IPv6 transition mechanisms are to be used in unmanaged networks.  In order to evaluate the suitability of these mechanisms, we need to define the scenarios in which these mechanisms have to be used.  One specific scope is the "unmanaged network", which typically corresponds to a home or small office network.  The scenarios are specific to a single subnet, and are defined in terms of IP connectivity supported by the gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP).  We first examine the generic requirements of four classes of applications: local, client, peer to peer and server.  Then, for each scenario, we infer transition requirements by analyzing the needs for smooth migration of applications from IPv4 to IPv6.

3755	A			RFCs from 2004							"Legacy Resolver Compatibility for Delegation Signer (DS)" was released in May of 2004 by S. Weiler. As the DNS Security (DNSSEC) specifications have evolved, the syntax and semantics of the DNSSEC resource records (RRs) have changed.  Many deployed nameservers understand variants of these semantics.  Dangerous interactions can occur when a resolver that understands an earlier version of these semantics queries an authoritative server that understands the new delegation signer semantics, including at least one failure scenario that will cause an unsecured zone to be unresolvable.  This document changes the type codes and mnemonics of the DNSSEC RRs (SIG, KEY, and NXT) to avoid those interactions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3755.txt

The existing IETF standards specify that IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) and Address Autoconfiguration mechanisms may be protected with IPsec Authentication Header (AH).  However, the current specifications limit the security solutions to manual keying due to practical problems faced with automatic key management.  This document specifies three different trust models and discusses the threats pertinent to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.

3757	A			RFCs from 2004							"Domain Name System KEY (DNSKEY) Resource Record (RR) Secure Entry Point (SEP) Flag" was released in April of 2004 by J. Schlyter, O. Kolkman, and E. Lewis. With the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record (RR), the concept of a public key acting as a secure entry point (SEP) has been introduced.  During exchanges of public keys with the parent there is a need to differentiate SEP keys from other public keys in the Domain Name System KEY (DNSKEY) resource record set.  A flag bit in the DNSKEY RR is defined to indicate that DNSKEY is to be used as a SEP.  The flag bit is intended to assist in operational procedures to correctly generate DS resource records, or to indicate what DNSKEYs are intended for static configuration.  The flag bit is not to be used in the DNS verification protocol.  This document updates RFC 2535 and RFC 3755. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3757.txt

This memo describes an extension to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) that allows an SCTP endpoint to signal to its peer that it should move the cumulative ack point forward.  When both sides of an SCTP association support this extension, it can be used by an SCTP implementation to provide partially reliable data transmission service to an upper layer protocol.  This memo describes the protocol extensions, which consist of a new parameter for INIT and INIT ACK, and a new FORWARD TSN chunk type, and provides one example of a partially reliable service that can be provided to the upper layer via this mechanism.

3766	A			RFCs from 2004							"Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric Keys" was released in April of 2004 by H. Orman, and P. Hoffman. Implementors of systems that use public key cryptography to exchange symmetric keys need to make the public keys resistant to some predetermined level of attack.  That level of attack resistance is the strength of the system, and the symmetric keys that are exchanged must be at least as strong as the system strength requirements.  The three quantities, system strength, symmetric key strength, and public key strength, must be consistently matched for any network protocol usage.  While it is fairly easy to express the system strength requirements in terms of a symmetric key length and to choose a cipher that has a key length equal to or exceeding that requirement, it is harder to choose a public key that has a cryptographic strength meeting a symmetric key strength requirement.  This document explains how to determine the length of an asymmetric key as a function of a symmetric key strength requirement.  Some rules of thumb for estimating equivalent resistance to large-scale attacks on various algorithms are given.  The document also addresses how changing the sizes of the underlying large integers (moduli, group sizes, exponents, and so on) changes the time to use the algorithms for key exchange.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3766.txt

3768	A			RFCs from 2004							"Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)" was released in April of 2004 by R. Hinden. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2338">RFC 2338</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5798">RFC 5798</a>. This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).  VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master, and forwards packets sent to these IP addresses.  The election process provides dynamic fail over in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become unavailable.  This allows any of the virtual router IP addresses on the LAN to be used as the default first hop router by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.

3775	A			RFCs from 2004							"Mobility Support in IPv6" was released in June of 2004 by C. Perkins, J. Arkko, and D. Johnson. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+6275">RFC 6275</a>. This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

The purpose of this document is to advance NewReno TCP's Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery algorithms in RFC 2582 from Experimental to Standards Track status.  The main change in this document relative to RFC 2582 is to specify the Careful variant of NewReno's Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery algorithms.  The base algorithm described in RFC 2582 did not attempt to avoid unnecessary multiple Fast Retransmits that can occur after a timeout.  However, RFC 2582 also defined "Careful" and "Less Careful" variants that avoid these unnecessary Fast Retransmits, and recommended the Careful variant.

3783	A			RFCs from 2004							"Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) Command Ordering Considerations with iSCSI" was released in May of 2004 by M. Chadalapaka, and R. Elliott. Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) transport protocol designed to run on top of TCP.  The iSCSI session abstraction is equivalent to the classic SCSI "I_T nexus", which represents the logical relationship between an Initiator and a Target (I and T) required in order to communicate via the SCSI family of protocols.  The iSCSI session provides an ordered command delivery from the SCSI initiator to the SCSI target.

Vedrenne, and R. Uppili. This document describes a common practice on how the existing metric of Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) can be used as an alternative metric to the Traffic Engineering (TE) metric for Constraint Based Routing of MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering tunnels.  This effectively results in the ability to perform Constraint Based Routing with optimization of one metric (e.g., link bandwidth) for some Traffic Engineering tunnels (e.g., Data Trunks) while optimizing another metric (e.g., propagation delay) for some other tunnels with different requirements (e.g., Voice Trunks).  No protocol extensions or modifications are required.  This text documents current router implementations and deployment practices.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3785.txt

3795	A			RFCs from 2004							"Survey of IPv4 Addresses in Currently Deployed IETF Application Area Standards Track and Experimental Documents" was released in June of 2004 by R. Sofia, P. Nesser, and II. This document describes IPv4 addressing dependencies in an attempt to clarify the necessary steps in re-designing and re-implementing specifications to become network address independent, or at least, to dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  This transition requires several interim steps, one of them being the evolution of current IPv4 dependent specifications to a format independent of the type of IP addressing schema used.  Hence, it is hoped that specifications will be re-designed and re-implemented to become network address independent, or at least to dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To achieve that step, it is necessary to survey and document all IPv4 dependencies experienced by current standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs.

3798	A			RFCs from 2004							"Message Disposition Notification" was released in May of 2004 by G. Vaudreuil, and T. Hansen. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2298">RFC 2298</a>. This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.  This content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message.  The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary "LAN-based" systems, and often referred to as "read receipts," "acknowledgements", or "receipt notifications." The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary "LAN-based" systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3798.txt
3801	A			RFCs from 2004							"Voice Profile for Internet Mail - version 2 (VPIMv2)" was released in June of 2004 by G. Parsons, and G. Vaudreuil. This document specifies a restricted profile of the Internet multimedia messaging protocols for use between voice processing server platforms.  The profile is referred to as the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) in this document.  These platforms have historically been special-purpose computers and often do not have the same facilities normally associated with a traditional Internet Email-capable computer.  As a result, VPIM also specifies additional functionality, as it is needed.  This profile is intended to specify the minimum common set of features to allow interworking between conforming systems.  This document obsoletes RFC 2421 and describes version 2 of the profile with greater precision.  No protocol changes were made in this revision.  A list of changes from RFC 2421 are noted in Appendix F.  Appendix A summarizes the protocol profiles of this version of VPIM. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3801.txt

3833	A			RFCs from 2004							"Threat Analysis of the Domain Name System (DNS)" was released in August of 2004 by D. Atkins, and R. Austein. Although the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) have been under development for most of the last decade, the IETF has never written down the specific set of threats against which DNSSEC is designed to protect.  Among other drawbacks, this cart-before-the-horse situation has made it difficult to determine whether DNSSEC meets its design goals, since its design goals are not well specified.  This note attempts to document some of the known threats to the DNS, and, in doing so, attempts to measure to what extent (if any) DNSSEC is a useful tool in defending against these threats.

3843	A			RFCs from 2004							"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): A Compression Profile for IP" was released in June of 2004 by G. Pelletier, and L-E. Jonsson. The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC (RFC 3095) defines a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles) for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), IP/UDP, and also a profile for uncompressed packet streams.  However, no profile was defined for compression of IP only, which has been identified as a missing piece in RFC 3095.  This document defines a ROHC compression profile for IP, similar to the IP/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095, but simplified to exclude UDP, and enhanced to compress IP header chains of arbitrary length.

3844	A			RFCs from 2004							"IETF Problem Resolution Process" was released in August of 2004 by J. Hofmann, and E. Davies. This Informational document records the history of discussions in the Problem WG during 2003 of how to resolve the problems described in the IETF Problem Statement.  It decomposes each of the problems described into a few areas for improvement and categorizes them as either problems affecting the routine processes used to create standards or problems affecting the fundamental structure and practices of the IETF.  Expeditious and non-disruptive solutions are proposed for the problems affecting routine processes.  The document also lists suggested ways to handle the development of solutions for the structure and practices problems proposed in IETF discussions.  Neither the working group nor the wider IETF has reached consensus on a recommendation for any of the proposals.  This document therefore has no alternative but to suggest that the search for structure and practices solutions be handed back to the control of the IESG.  While there was working group consensus on the processes for short-term and medium term improvements, there was no working group consensus on the proposals for longer-term improvements.  This document therefore includes longer-term improvement proposals only as a matter of record; they must not be regarded as recommendations from the working group.

3846	A			RFCs from 2004							"Mobile IPv4 Extension for Carrying Network Access Identifiers" was released in June of 2004 by F. Johansson, and T. Johansson. When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks, it has to be re-authenticated.  If the home network has both multiple Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers and Home Agents (HAs) in use, the Home AAA server may not have sufficient information to process the re-authentication correctly (i.e., to ensure that the same HA continues to be used).  This document defines a Mobile IP extension that carries identities for the Home AAA and HA servers in the form of Network Access Identifiers (NAIs).  The extension allows a Home Agent to pass its identity (and that of the Home AAA server) to the mobile node, which can then pass it on to the local AAA server when changing its point of attachment.  This extension may also be used in other situations requiring communication of a NAI between Mobile IP nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3846.txt

To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 unicast address prefix is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.  Since site-local and link-local unicast addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these addresses cannot be used in many example situations.  The document describes the use of the IPv6 address prefix 2001:DB8::/32 as a reserved prefix for use in documentation.

This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of presence.  Presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with other users on the network.  Historically, presence has been limited to "on-line" and "off-line" indicators; the notion of presence here is broader.  Subscriptions and notifications of presence are supported by defining an event package within the general SIP event notification framework.  This protocol is also compliant with the Common Presence Profile (CPP) framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3856.txt

This document defines the watcher information template-package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework.  Watcher information refers to the set of users subscribed to a particular resource within a particular event package.  Watcher information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe, are approved, or are rejected.  A user can subscribe to this information, and therefore learn about changes to it.  This event package is a template-package because it can be applied to any event package, including itself. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3857.txt
3858	A			RFCs from 2004							"An Extensible Markup Language (XML) Based Format for Watcher Information" was released in August of 2004 by J. Rosenberg. Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to) information about a resource.  There is fairly complex state associated with these subscriptions.  The union of the state for all subscriptions to a particular resource is called the watcher information for that resource.  This state is dynamic, changing as subscribers come and go.  As a result, it is possible, and indeed useful, to subscribe to the watcher information for a particular resource.  In order to enable this, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers on a resource.  This specification describes an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format for such state.

3883	A			RFCs from 2004							"Detecting Inactive Neighbors over OSPF Demand Circuits (DC)" was released in October of 2004 by A. Zinin, A. Roy, and S. Rao. OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.  OSPF behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize the amount of overhead traffic.  A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions is the Hello suppression mechanism.  This technique allows a demand circuit to go down when no interesting traffic is going through the link.  However, it also introduces a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor over such a link.  This memo introduces a new mechanism called "neighbor probing" to address the above problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3883.txt
3884	A			RFCs from 2004							"Use of IPsec Transport Mode for Dynamic Routing" was released in September of 2004 by Y. Wang, L. Eggert, and J. Touch. IPsec can secure the links of a multihop network to protect communication between trusted components, e.g., for a secure virtual network (VN), overlay, or virtual private network (VPN).  Virtual links established by IPsec tunnel mode can conflict with routing and forwarding inside VNs because IP routing depends on references to interfaces and next-hop IP addresses.  The IPsec tunnel mode specification is ambiguous on this issue, so even compliant implementations cannot be trusted to avoid conflicts.  An alternative to tunnel mode uses non-IPsec IPIP encapsulation together with IPsec transport mode, which we call IIPtran.  IPIP encapsulation occurs as a separate initial step, as the result of a forwarding lookup of the VN packet.  IPsec transport mode processes the resulting (tunneled) IP packet with an SA determined through a security association database (SAD) match on the tunnel header.  IIPtran supports dynamic routing inside the VN without changes to the current IPsec architecture.  IIPtran demonstrates how to configure any compliant IPsec implementation to avoid the aforementioned conflicts.  IIPtran is also compared to several alternative mechanisms for VN routing and their respective impact on IPsec, routing, policy enforcement, and interactions with the Internet Key Exchange (IKE).

3892	A			RFCs from 2004							"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Referred-By Mechanism" was released in September of 2004 by R. Sparks. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER method provides a mechanism where one party (the referrer) gives a second party (the referee) an arbitrary URI to reference.  If that URI is a SIP URI, the referee will send a SIP request, often an INVITE, to that URI (the refer target).  This document extends the REFER method, allowing the referrer to provide information about the REFER request to the refer target using the referee as an intermediary.  This information includes the identity of the referrer and the URI to which the referrer referred.  The mechanism utilizes S/MIME to help protect this information from a malicious intermediary.  This protection is optional, but a recipient may refuse to accept a request unless it is present. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3892.txt
3893	A			RFCs from 2004							"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authenticated Identity Body (AIB) Format" was released in September of 2004 by J. Peterson. RFC 3261 introduces the concept of adding an S/MIME body to a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request or response in order to provide reference integrity over its headers.  This document provides a more specific mechanism to derive integrity and authentication properties from an 'authenticated identity body', a digitally-signed SIP message, or message fragment.  A standard format for such bodies (known as Authenticated Identity Bodies, or AIBs) is given in this document.  Some considerations for the processing of AIBs by recipients of SIP messages with such bodies are also given. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3893.txt

Lu, and V. Gurbani. This document describes the Services in PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) requesting Internet Services (SPIRITS) protocol.  The purpose of the SPIRITS protocol is to support services that originate in the cellular or wireline PSTN and necessitate interactions between the PSTN and the Internet.  On the PSTN side, the SPIRITS services are most often initiated from the Intelligent Network (IN) entities.  Internet Call Waiting and Internet Caller-ID Delivery are examples of SPIRITS services, as are location-based services on the cellular network.  The protocol defines the building blocks from which many other services can be built. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3910.txt

3913	A			RFCs from 2004							"Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP): Protocol Specification" was released in September of 2004 by D. Thaler. This document describes the Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP), a protocol for inter-domain multicast routing.  BGMP builds shared trees for active multicast groups, and optionally allows receiver domains to build source-specific, inter-domain, distribution branches where needed.  BGMP natively supports "source-specific multicast" (SSM).  To also support "any-source multicast" (ASM), BGMP requires that each multicast group be associated with a single root (in BGMP it is referred to as the root domain).  It requires that different ranges of the multicast address space are associated (e.g., with Unicast-Prefix-Based Multicast addressing) with different domains.  Each of these domains then becomes the root of the shared domain-trees for all groups in its range.  Multicast participants will generally receive better multicast service if the session initiator's address allocator selects addresses from its own domain's part of the space, thereby causing the root domain to be local to at least one of the session participants.

3927	A			RFCs from 2005							"Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses" was released in May of 2005 by E. Guttman, S. Cheshire, and B. Aboba. To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available. This document describes how a host may automatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the 169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices connected to the same physical (or logical) link.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3927.txt

3933	A			RFCs from 2004							"A Model for IETF Process Experiments" was released in November of 2004 by J. Klensin, and S. Dawkins. The IETF has designed process changes over the last ten years in one of two ways: announcement by the IESG, sometimes based on informal agreements with limited community involvement and awareness, and formal use of the same mechanism used for protocol specification.  The first mechanism has often proven to be too lightweight, the second too heavyweight.  This document specifies a middle-ground approach to the system of making changes to IETF process, one that relies heavily on a "propose and carry out an experiment, evaluate the experiment, and then establish permanent procedures based on operational experience" model rather than those previously attempted.

3940	A			RFCs from 2004							"Negative-acknowledgment (NACK)-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) Protocol" was released in November of 2004 by B. Adamson, J. Macker, C. Bormann, and M. Handley. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5740">RFC 5740</a>. This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative-acknowledgment (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol.  This protocol is designed to provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal "a priori" coordination among senders and receivers.  A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways.  The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based repair and other IETF reliable multicast transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3940.txt

The rationale for NORM goals and assumptions are presented.  Technical challenges for NACK-oriented (and in some cases general) reliable multicast protocol operation are identified.  These goals and challenges are resolved into a set of functional "building blocks" that address different aspects of NORM protocol operation.  It is anticipated that these building blocks will be useful in generating different instantiations of reliable multicast protocols.

The International Telecommunications Union Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has created the H.350 series of Recommendations that specify directory services architectures in support of multimedia conferencing protocols.  The goal of the architecture is to 'directory enable' multimedia conferencing so that these services can leverage existing identity management and enterprise directories.  A particular goal is to enable an enterprise or service provider to maintain a canonical source of users and their multimedia conferencing systems, so that multiple call servers from multiple vendors, supporting multiple protocols, can all access the same data store.  Because SIP is an IETF standard, the contents of H.350 and H.350.4 are made available via this document to the IETF community.  This document contains the entire normative text of ITU-T Recommendations H.350 and H.350.4 in sections 4 and 5, respectively.

3957	A			RFCs from 2005							"Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Registration Keys for Mobile IPv4" was released in March of 2005 by C. Perkins, and P. Calhoun. Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, such as RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within the Internet today to provide authentication and authorization services for dial-up computers.  Mobile IP for IPv4 requires strong authentication between the mobile node and its home agent.  When the mobile node shares an AAA Security Association with its home AAA server, however, it is possible to use that AAA Security Association to create derived Mobility Security Associations between the mobile node and its home agent, and again between the mobile node and the foreign agent currently offering connectivity to the mobile node.  This document specifies extensions to Mobile IP registration messages that can be used to create Mobility Security Associations between the mobile node and its home agent, and/or between the mobile node and a foreign agent.

IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from other standards bodies).  For example, a standards track document may not have a normative reference to an informational RFC.

3972	A			RFCs from 2005							"Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA)" was released in March of 2005 by T. Aura. This document describes a method for binding a public signature key to an IPv6 address in the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol.  Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary parameters.  The binding between the public key and the address can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification authority or any security infrastructure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3972.txt

4066	A			RFCs from 2005							"Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD)" was released in July of 2005 by E. Shim, M. Liebsch, A. Singh, H. Chaskar, and D. Funato. To enable seamless IP-layer handover of a mobile node (MN) from one access router (AR) to another, the MN is required to discover the identities and capabilities of candidate ARs (CARs) for handover prior to the initiation of the handover.  The act of discovery of CARs has two aspects: identifying the IP addresses of the CARs and finding their capabilities.  This process is called "candidate access router discovery" (CARD).  At the time of IP-layer handover, the CAR, whose capabilities are a good match to the preferences of the MN, is chosen as the target AR for handover.

Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover.  During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This "handover latency" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement detection, new Care of Address configuration, and Binding Update, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP.  Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the link switching latency.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4068.txt

IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration are able to configure their IPv6 address and default router settings automatically.  However, further settings are not available.  If these hosts wish to configure their DNS, NTP, or other specific settings automatically, the stateless variant of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) could be used.  This combination of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and stateless DHCPv6 could be used quite commonly in IPv6 networks.  However, hosts using this combination currently have no means by which to be informed of changes in stateless DHCPv6 option settings; e.g., the addition of a new NTP server address, a change in DNS search paths, or full site renumbering.  This document is presented as a problem statement from which a solution should be proposed in a subsequent document.

Perrig, B. Briscoe, R. Canetti, and D. Song. This document introduces Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA). TESLA allows all receivers to check the integrity and authenticate the source of each packet in multicast or broadcast data streams. TESLA requires no trust between receivers, uses low-cost operations per packet at both sender and receiver, can tolerate any level of loss without retransmissions, and requires no per-receiver state at the sender. TESLA can protect receivers against denial of service attacks in certain circumstances. Each receiver must be loosely time-synchronized with the source in order to verify messages, but otherwise receivers do not have to send any messages. TESLA alone cannot support non-repudiation of the data source to third parties.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4082.txt

Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4086.txt

McCloghrie. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Internet Standard Management Framework are widely used for the management of communication devices, creating a need to specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object instances) from non-SNMP management environments. For example, when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP access), a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device for management is needed. Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) fit this need well, as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4088.txt

This document describes how to use the Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) semantics of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) grouping framework in SIP.  In particular, we define the sdp-anat SIP option-tag.  This SIP option-tag ensures that SDP session descriptions that use ANAT are only handled by SIP entities with ANAT support.  To justify the need for such a SIP option-tag, we describe what could possibly happen if an ANAT-unaware SIP entity tried to handle media lines grouped with ANAT.

This document addresses security aspects pertaining to Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs).  First, it describes the security threats in the context of PPVPNs and defensive techniques to combat those threats.  It considers security issues deriving both from malicious behavior of anyone and from negligent or incorrect behavior of the providers.  It also describes how these security attacks should be detected and reported.  It then discusses possible user requirements for security of a PPVPN service.  These user requirements translate into corresponding provider requirements.  In addition, the provider may have additional requirements to make its network infrastructure secure to a level that can meet the PPVPN customer's expectations.  Finally, this document defines a template that may be used to describe and analyze the security characteristics of a specific PPVPN technology.

When a host establishes a new link-layer connection, it may or may not have a valid IP configuration for Internet connectivity.  The host may check for link change (i.e., determine whether a link change has occurred), and then, based on the result, it can automatically decide whether its IP configuration is still valid.  During link identity detection, the host may also collect necessary information to initiate a new IP configuration if the IP subnet has changed.  In this memo, this procedure is called Detecting Network Attachment (DNA).  DNA schemes should be precise, sufficiently fast, secure, and of limited signaling.

This set of state machines shows how EAP can be implemented to support deployment in either a peer/authenticator or peer/authenticator/AAA Server environment. The peer and stand-alone authenticator machines are illustrative of how the EAP protocol defined in RFC 3748 may be implemented. The backend and full/pass-through authenticators illustrate how EAP/AAA protocol support defined in RFC 3579 may be implemented. Where there are differences, RFC 3748 and RFC 3579 are authoritative.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4137.txt
4138	A			RFCs from 2005							"Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An Algorithm for Detecting Spurious Retransmission Timeouts with TCP and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)" was released in August of 2005 by M. Kojo, and P. Sarolahti. Spurious retransmission timeouts cause suboptimal TCP performance because they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the last window of data.  This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for detecting spurious TCP retransmission timeouts.  F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm that does not require any TCP options to operate.  After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segment triggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors the incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout was spurious.  It then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments.  The algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP performance in the case of a spurious timeout.  The F-RTO algorithm can also be applied to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4138.txt

A message originator sometimes sends content in a form the recipient cannot process or would prefer not to process a form of lower quality than is preferred.  Such content needs to be converted to an acceptable form, with the same information or constrained information (e.g., changing from color to black and white).  In a store-and-forward environment, it may be convenient to have this conversion performed by an intermediary.  This specification integrates two ESMTP extensions and three MIME content header fields, which defines a cooperative service that permits authorized, accountable content form conversion by intermediaries.

4247	A			RFCs from 2005							"Requirements for Header Compression over MPLS" was released in November of 2005 by R. Zhang, B. Goode, J. Hand, and J. Ash. Voice over IP (VoIP) typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP.  When MPLS labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels.  For an MPLS VPN, the packet header is typically 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30 bytes, for example.  Header compression can significantly reduce the overhead through various compression mechanisms, such as enhanced compressed RTP (ECRTP) and robust header compression (ROHC).  We consider using MPLS to route compressed packets over an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) without compression/decompression cycles at each router.  This approach can increase the bandwidth efficiency as well as processing scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous flows that use header compression at each router.  In this document, we give a problem statement, goals and requirements, and an example scenario.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4247.txt

Gray, V. Sharma, E. Mannie, and G. Bernstein. Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is a suite of protocol extensions to MPLS to make it generally applicable, to include, for example, control of non packet-based switching, and particularly, optical switching.  One consideration is to use GMPLS protocols to upgrade the control plane of optical transport networks.  This document illustrates this process by describing those extensions to GMPLS protocols that are aimed at controlling Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) networks.  SDH/SONET networks make good examples of this process for a variety of reasons.  This document highlights extensions to GMPLS-related routing protocols to disseminate information needed in transport path computation and network operations, together with (G)MPLS protocol extensions required for the provisioning of transport circuits.

In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a standardized method for identifying users.  This document defines the syntax for the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the client during network authentication. "Roaming" may be loosely defined as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, \%customer-vendor relationship with only one.  Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP "confederations" and \%ISP-provided corporate network access support.  This document is a revised version of RFC 2486, which originally defined NAIs.

4284	A			RFCs from 2006							"Identity Selection Hints for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)" was released in January of 2006 by V. Lortz, P. Eronen, F. Bari, and F. Adrangi. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in RFC 3748. This document defines a mechanism that allows an access network to provide identity selection hints to an EAP peer -- the end of the link that responds to the authenticator. The purpose is to assist the EAP peer in selecting an appropriate Network Access Identifier (NAI). This is useful in situations where the peer does not receive a lower-layer indication of what network it is connecting to, or when there is no direct roaming relationship between the access network and the peer's home network. In the latter case, authentication is typically accomplished via a mediating network such as a roaming consortium or broker.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4284.txt
4285	A			RFCs from 2006							"Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6" was released in January of 2006 by H. Akhtar, K. Chowdhury, K. Leung, A. Patel, and M. Khalil.

This document explores the issues in the registration of internationalized domain names (IDNs).  The basic IDN definition allows a very large number of possible characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion about similar-looking names.  To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process must impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations.  This document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and implement such rules for a broad range of languages, including adaptation of methods developed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names.

4367	A			RFCs from 2006							"What's in a Name: False Assumptions about DNS Names" was released in February of 2006 by IAB, and J. Rosenberg. The Domain Name System (DNS) provides an essential service on the Internet, mapping structured names to a variety of data, usually IP addresses.  These names appear in email addresses, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), and other application-layer identifiers that are often rendered to human users.  Because of this, there has been a strong demand to acquire names that have significance to people, through equivalence to registered trademarks, company names, types of services, and so on.  There is a danger in this trend; the humans and automata that consume and use such names will associate specific semantics with some names and thereby make assumptions about the services that are, or should be, provided by the hosts associated with the names.  Those assumptions can often be false, resulting in a variety of failure conditions.  This document discusses this problem in more detail and makes recommendations on how it can be avoided.

4410	A			RFCs from 2006							"Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP)" was released in February of 2006 by D. Cohen, M. Pullen, and F. Zhao. The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is a transport protocol, intended to deliver a mix of reliable and best-effort messages in an any-to-any multicast environment, where the best-effort traffic occurs in significantly greater volume than the reliable traffic and therefore can carry sequence numbers of reliable messages for loss detection.  SRMP is intended for use in a distributed simulation application environment, where only the latest value of reliable transmission for any particular data identifier requires delivery.  SRMP has two sublayers: a bundling sublayer handling message aggregation and congestion control, and a Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) sublayer.  Selection between reliable and best-effort messages is performed by the application.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4410.txt
4411	A			RFCs from 2006							"Extending the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header for Preemption Events" was released in February of 2006 by J. Polk. This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to be included in a BYE Method Request as a result of a session preemption event, either at a user agent (UA), or somewhere in the network involving a reservation-based protocol such as the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) or Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS).  This document does not attempt to address routers failing in the packet path; instead, it addresses a deliberate tear down of a flow between UAs, and informs the terminated UA(s) with an indication of what occurred.

4413	A			RFCs from 2006							"TCP/IP Field Behavior" was released in March of 2006 by M. West, and S. McCann. This memo describes TCP/IP field behavior in the context of header compression.  Header compression is possible because most header fields do not vary randomly from packet to packet.  Many of the fields exhibit static behavior or change in a more or less predictable way.  When a header compression scheme is designed, it is of fundamental importance to understand the behavior of the fields in detail.  An example of this analysis can be seen in RFC 3095.  This memo performs a similar role for the compression of TCP/IP headers.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4413.txt

On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-text password mechanism using "anonymous" as the user name and using optional trace information, such as an email address, as the password.  As plain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.

Rahman. Use of Node-ID based Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Hello messages is implied in a number of cases, e.g., when data and control planes are separated, when TE links are unnumbered.  Furthermore, when link level failure detection is performed by some means other than exchanging RSVP Hello messages, use of a Node-ID based Hello session is optimal for detecting signaling adjacency failure for Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  Nonetheless, this implied behavior is unclear, and this document formalizes use of the Node-ID based RSVP Hello session in some scenarios.  The procedure described in this document applies to both Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) capable nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4558.txt

In the context of MPLS TE Fast Reroute, the Merge Point (MP) address is required at the Point of Local Repair (PLR) in order to select a backup tunnel intersecting a fast reroutable Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) on a downstream Label Switching Router (LSR).  However, existing protocol mechanisms are not sufficient to find an MP address in multi-domain routing networks where a domain is defined as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous System (AS).  Hence, the current MPLS Fast Reroute mechanism cannot be used in order to protect inter-domain TE LSPs from a failure of an Area Border Router (ABR) or Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR).  This document specifies the use of existing Record Route Object (RRO) IPv4 and IPv6 sub-objects (with a new flag defined) thus defining the node-id sub-object in order to solve this issue.

Pillay-Esnault, E. Rosen, and P. Psenak. This document specifies a procedure that deals with a particular issue that may arise when a Service Provider (SP) provides "BGP/MPLS IP VPN" service to a customer and the customer uses OSPFv2 to advertise its routes to the SP.  In this situation, a Customer Edge (CE) Router and a Provider Edge (PE) Router are OSPF peers, and customer routes are sent via OSPFv2 from the CE to the PE.  The customer routes are converted into BGP routes, and BGP carries them across the backbone to other PE routers.  The routes are then converted back to OSPF routes sent via OSPF to other CE routers.  As a result of this conversion, some of the information needed to prevent loops may be lost.  A procedure is needed to ensure that once a route is sent from a PE to a CE, the route will be ignored by any PE that receives it back from a CE.  This document specifies the necessary procedure, using one of the options bits in the LSA (Link State Advertisements) to indicate that an LSA has already been forwarded by a PE and should be ignored by any other PEs that see it.

Many Service Providers offer Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to their customers, using a technique in which customer edge routers (CE routers) are routing peers of provider edge routers (PE routers). The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the provider's backbone. This is known as a "BGP/MPLS IP VPN". The base specification for BGP/MPLS IP VPNs presumes that the routing protocol on the interface between a PE router and a CE router is BGP. This document extends that specification by allowing the routing protocol on the PE/CE interface to be the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4577.txt

Burmeister, and J. Ott. Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses.  Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term.  This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).  This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented.  This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4585.txt

Holbrook, B. Haberman, and B. Cain. The Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and the Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) are protocols that allow a host to inform its neighboring routers of its desire to receive IPv4 and IPv6 multicast transmissions, respectively.  Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast in which a receiver is required to specify both the network-layer address of the source and the multicast destination address in order to receive the multicast transmission.  This document defines the notion of an "SSM-aware" router and host, and clarifies and (in some cases) modifies the behavior of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 on SSM-aware routers and hosts to accommodate source-specific multicast.  This document updates the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4604.txt

4653	A			RFCs from 2006							"Improving the Robustness of TCP to Non-Congestion Events" was released in August of 2006 by M. Allman, E. Blanton, A. L. N. Reddy, and S. Bhandarkar. This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for TCP.  In the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network, TCP uses loss as an indication of congestion.  One of the ways TCP detects loss is using the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments.  However, this heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case when network paths reorder segments (for whatever reason), resulting in degraded performance.  TCP-NCR is designed to mitigate this degraded performance by increasing the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the current state of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate true segment loss from segment reordering.  This document specifies the changes to TCP, as well as the costs and benefits of these modifications.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4653.txt
4654	A			RFCs from 2006							"TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC): Protocol Specification" was released in August of 2006 by J. Widmer, and M. Handley. This document specifies TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC).  TFMCC is a congestion control mechanism for multicast transmissions in a best-effort Internet environment.  It is a single-rate congestion control scheme, where the sending rate is adapted to the receiver experiencing the worst network conditions.  TFMCC is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows and has a relatively low variation of throughput over time, making it suitable for applications where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance, such as streaming media.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4654.txt

Costa-Requena. The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of changes to a state of a resource.  The document does not describe a mechanism whereby filtering of event notification information can be achieved.  Filtering is a mechanism for defining the preferred notification information to be delivered and for specifying triggers that cause that information to be delivered.

4701	A			RFCs from 2006							"A DNS Resource Record (RR) for Encoding Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Information (DHCID RR)" was released in October of 2006 by A. Gustafsson, M. Stapp, and T. Lemon. It is possible for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients to attempt to update the same DNS Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or to update a DNS FQDN that has been added to the DNS for another purpose as they obtain DHCP leases.  Whether the DHCP server or the clients themselves perform the DNS updates, conflicts can arise.  To resolve such conflicts, RFC 4703 proposes storing client identifiers in the DNS to unambiguously associate domain names with the DHCP clients to which they refer.  This memo defines a distinct Resource Record (RR) type for this purpose for use by DHCP clients and servers: the "DHCID" RR. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4701.txt

4728	A			RFCs from 2007							"The Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (DSR) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for IPv4" was released in February of 2007 by D. Maltz, D. Johnson, and Y. Hu. The Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is a simple and efficient routing protocol designed specifically for use in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks of mobile nodes.  DSR allows the network to be completely self-organizing and self-configuring, without the need for any existing network infrastructure or administration.  The protocol is composed of the two main mechanisms of "Route Discovery" and "Route Maintenance", which work together to allow nodes to discover and maintain routes to arbitrary destinations in the ad hoc network.  All aspects of the protocol operate entirely on demand, allowing the routing packet overhead of DSR to scale automatically to only what is needed to react to changes in the routes currently in use.  The protocol allows multiple routes to any destination and allows each sender to select and control the routes used in routing its packets, for example, for use in load balancing or for increased robustness.  Other advantages of the DSR protocol include easily guaranteed loop-free routing, operation in networks containing unidirectional links, use of only "soft state" in routing, and very rapid recovery when routes in the network change.  The DSR protocol is designed mainly for mobile ad hoc networks of up to about two hundred nodes and is designed to work well even with very high rates of mobility.  This document specifies the operation of the DSR protocol for routing unicast IPv4 packets.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4728.txt

This document defines a mechanism for the reoptimization of loosely routed MPLS and GMPLS (Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) signaled with Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  This document proposes a mechanism that allows a TE LSP head-end Label Switching Router (LSR) to trigger a new path re-evaluation on every hop that has a next hop defined as a loose or abstract hop and a mid-point LSR to signal to the head-end LSR that a better path exists (compared to the current path) or that the TE LSP must be reoptimized (because of maintenance required on the TE LSP path).  The proposed mechanism applies to the cases of intra- and inter-domain (Interior Gateway Protocol area (IGP area) or Autonomous System) packet and non-packet TE LSPs following a loosely routed path.

This memo defines metrics to evaluate whether a network has maintained packet order on a packet-by-packet basis.  It provides motivations for the new metrics and discusses the measurement issues, including the context information required for all metrics.  The memo first defines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design.  Additional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the distance between separate occurrences.  We then define a metric oriented toward assessment of reordering effects on TCP.  Several examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are included.  An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating order with packet fragmentation.

Dondeti. The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) specification describes several modes of key distribution solution that address multimedia scenarios (e.g., SIP calls and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) sessions) using pre-shared keys, public keys, and optionally a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  In the public-key mode, the Initiator encrypts a random key with the Responder's public key and sends it to the Responder.  In many communication scenarios, the Initiator may not know the Responder's public key, or in some cases the Responder's ID (e.g., call forwarding) in advance.  We propose a new MIKEY mode that works well in such scenarios.  This mode also enhances the group key management support in MIKEY; it supports member-initiated group key download (in contrast to group manager pushing the group keys to all members).  This document updates RFC 3830 with the RSA-R mode. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4738.txt

The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol supports several mechanisms for authenticating the parties, including signatures with public-key certificates, shared secrets, and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods.  Currently, each endpoint uses only one of these mechanisms to authenticate itself.  This document specifies an extension to IKEv2 that allows the use of multiple authentication exchanges, using either different mechanisms or the same mechanism.  This extension allows, for instance, performing certificate-based authentication of the client host followed by an EAP authentication of the user.  When backend authentication servers are used, they can belong to different administrative domains, such as the network access provider and the service provider.

4768	A			RFCs from 2006							"Desired Enhancements to Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Version 3 Naming" was released in December of 2006 by S. Hartman. The Generic Security Services API (GSS-API) provides a naming architecture that supports name-based authorization.  GSS-API authenticates two named parties to each other.  Names can be stored on access control lists (ACLs) to make authorization decisions.  Advances in security mechanisms and the way implementers wish to use GSS-API require this model to be extended for the next version of GSS-API.  As people move within an organization or change their names, the name authenticated by GSS-API may change.  Using some sort of constant identifier would make ACLs more stable.  Some mechanisms, such as public-key mechanisms, do not have a single name to be used across all environments.  Other mechanisms, such as Kerberos, may include group membership or role information as part of authentication.  This document motivates extensions to GSS-API naming and describes the extensions under discussion.

Norrman. This document defines an integrity transform for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP; see RFC 3711), which allows the roll-over counter (ROC) to be transmitted in SRTP packets as part of the authentication tag.  The need for sending the ROC in SRTP packets arises in situations where the receiver joins an ongoing SRTP session and needs to quickly and robustly synchronize.  The mechanism also enhances SRTP operation in cases where there is a risk of losing sender-receiver synchronization. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4771.txt
4772	A			RFCs from 2006							"Security Implications of Using the Data Encryption Standard (DES)" was released in December of 2006 by S. Kelly. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is susceptible to brute-force attacks, which are well within the reach of a modestly financed adversary.  As a result, DES has been deprecated, and replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  Nonetheless, many applications continue to rely on DES for security, and designers and implementers continue to support it in new applications.  While this is not always inappropriate, it frequently is.  This note discusses DES security implications in detail, so that designers and implementers have all the information they need to make judicious decisions regarding its use.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4772.txt

4775	A			RFCs from 2006							"Procedures for Protocol Extensions and Variations" was released in December of 2006 by T. Narten, B. Carpenter, and S. Bradner. This document discusses procedural issues related to the extensibility of IETF protocols, including when it is reasonable to extend IETF protocols with little or no review, and when extensions or variations need to be reviewed by the IETF community. Experience has shown that extension of protocols without early IETF review can carry risk. The document also recommends that major extensions to or variations of IETF protocols only take place through normal IETF processes or in coordination with the IETF.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4775.txt

RFC 1264 was written during what was effectively a completely different time in the life of the Internet.  It prescribed rules to protect the Internet against new routing protocols that may have various undesirable properties.  In today's Internet, there are so many other pressures against deploying unreasonable protocols that we believe that existing controls suffice, and the RFC 1264 rules just get in the way.

4795	A			RFCs from 2007							"Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)" was released in January of 2007 by L. Esibov, D. Thaler, and B. Aboba. The goal of Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is to enable name resolution in scenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.  LLMNR supports all current and future DNS formats, types, and classes, while operating on a separate port from DNS, and with a distinct resolver cache.  Since LLMNR only operates on the local link, it cannot be considered a substitute for DNS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4795.txt

This document describes an implementation strategy for BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in which the outermost MPLS label (i.e., the tunnel label) is replaced with either an IP header or an IP header with Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4797.txt
4798	A			RFCs from 2007							"Connecting IPv6 Islands over IPv4 MPLS Using IPv6 Provider Edge Routers (6PE)" was released in February of 2007 by J. De Clercq, F. Le Faucheur, S. Prevost, and D. Ooms. This document explains how to interconnect IPv6 islands over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv4 cloud.  This approach relies on IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE), which are Dual Stack in order to connect to IPv6 islands and to the MPLS core, which is only required to run IPv4 MPLS.  The 6PE routers exchange the IPv6 reachability information transparently over the core using the Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4.  In doing so, the BGP Next Hop field is used to convey the IPv4 address of the 6PE router so that dynamically established IPv4-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without explicit tunnel configuration.

4804	A			RFCs from 2007							"Aggregation of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Reservations over MPLS TE/DS-TE Tunnels" was released in February of 2007 by F. Le Faucheur. RFC 3175 specifies aggregation of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) end-to-end reservations over aggregate RSVP reservations.  This document specifies aggregation of RSVP end-to-end reservations over MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels or MPLS Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) tunnels.  This approach is based on RFC 3175 and simply modifies the corresponding procedures for operations over MPLS TE tunnels instead of aggregate RSVP reservations.  This approach can be used to achieve admission control of a very large number of flows in a scalable manner since the devices in the core of the network are unaware of the end-to-end RSVP reservations and are only aware of the MPLS TE tunnels.

4806	A			RFCs from 2007							"Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Extensions to IKEv2" was released in February of 2007 by H. Tschofenig, and M. Myers. While the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) supports public key based authentication, the corresponding use of in-band Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) is problematic due to unbounded CRL size. The size of an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) response is however well-bounded and small. This document defines the "OCSP Content" extension to IKEv2. A CERTREQ payload with "OCSP Content" identifies zero or more trusted OCSP responders and is a request for inclusion of an OCSP response in the IKEv2 handshake. A cooperative recipient of such a request responds with a CERT payload containing the appropriate OCSP response. This content is recognizable via the same "OCSP Content" identifier.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4806.txt

4811	A			RFCs from 2007							"OSPF Out-of-Band Link State Database (LSDB) Resynchronization" was released in March of 2007 by A. Zinin, A. Roy, and L. Nguyen. OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks. Link State Database (LSDB) synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods -- initial LSDB synchronization when an OSPF router has just been connected to the network and asynchronous flooding that ensures continuous LSDB synchronization in the presence of topology changes after the initial procedure was completed. It may sometime be necessary for OSPF routers to resynchronize their LSDBs. The OSPF standard, however, does not allow routers to do so without actually changing the topology view of the network.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4811.txt
4812	A			RFCs from 2007							"OSPF Restart Signaling" was released in March of 2007 by A. Zinin, A. Roy, and L. Nguyen. OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks. Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via the Hello subprotocol. Hello OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-way connectivity within time. When a router restarts its OSPF software, it may not know its neighbors. If such a router sends a Hello packet on an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the adjacency, which may not be desirable in certain conditions.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4812.txt

OSPF routers exchange information on a link using packets that follow a well-defined format.  The format of OSPF packets is not flexible enough to enable applications to exchange arbitrary data, which may be necessary in certain situations.

4814	A			RFCs from 2007							"Hash and Stuffing: Overlooked Factors in Network Device Benchmarking" was released in March of 2007 by D. Newman, and T. Player. Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect a given measurement, including intended load, packet length, test duration, and traffic orientation.  However, current benchmarking practice overlooks two factors that have a profound impact on test results.  First, existing methodologies do not require the reporting of addresses or other test traffic contents, even though these fields can affect test results.  Second, "stuff" bits and bytes inserted in test traffic by some link-layer technologies add significant and variable overhead, which in turn affects test results.  This document describes the effects of these factors; recommends guidelines for test traffic contents; and offers formulas for determining the probability of bit- and byte-stuffing in test traffic.

4826	A			RFCs from 2007							"Extensible Markup Language (XML) Formats for Representing Resource Lists" was released in May of 2007 by J. Rosenberg. In multimedia communications, presence, and instant messaging systems, there is a need to define Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that represent services that are associated with a group of users.  One example is a resource list service.  If a user sends a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) SUBSCRIBE message to the URI representing the resource list service, the server will obtain the state of the users in the associated group, and provide it to the sender.  To facilitate definition of these services, this specification defines two Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents.  One document contains service URIs, along with their service definition and a reference to the associated group of users.  The second document contains the user lists that are referenced from the first.  This list of users can be utilized by other applications and services.

When the establishment of a higher priority (Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path) TE LSP requires the preemption of a set of lower priority TE LSPs, a node has to make a local decision to select which TE LSPs will be preempted.  The preempted LSPs are then rerouted by their respective \%Head-end Label Switch Router (LSR).  This document presents a flexible policy that can be used to achieve different objectives: preempt the lowest priority LSPs; preempt the minimum number of LSPs; preempt the set of TE LSPs that provide the closest amount of bandwidth to the required bandwidth for the preempting TE LSPs (to minimize bandwidth wastage); preempt the LSPs that will have the maximum chance to get rerouted.  Simulation results are given and a comparison among several different policies, with respect to preemption cascading, number of preempted LSPs, priority, wasted bandwidth and blocking probability is also included.

4843	A			RFCs from 2007							"An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID)" was released in April of 2007 by F. Dupont, J. Laganier, and P. Nikander. This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address- like identifiers. These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to appear as application layer entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6 headers. To make them more like vanilla IPv6 addresses, they are expected to be routable at an overlay level. Consequently, while they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4843.txt

4846	A			RFCs from 2007							"Independent Submissions to the RFC Editor" was released in July of 2007 by J. Klensin, and D. Thaler. There is a long-standing tradition in the Internet community, predating the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) by many years, of use of the RFC Series to publish materials that are not rooted in the IETF standards process and its review and approval mechanisms.  These documents, known as "Independent Submissions", serve a number of important functions for the Internet community, both inside and outside of the community of active IETF participants.  This document discusses the Independent Submission model and some reasons why it is important.  It then describes editorial and processing norms that can be used for Independent Submissions as the community goes forward into new relationships between the IETF community and its primary technical publisher.

While RFC 2865 defines the Filter-Id attribute, it requires that the Network Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated with the desired filters.  However, in situations where the server operator does not know which filters have been pre-populated, it is useful to specify filter rules explicitly.  This document defines the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute within the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS).  This attribute is based on the Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) described in RFC 4005, and the IPFilterRule syntax defined in RFC 3588.

4857	A			RFCs from 2007							"Mobile IPv4 Regional Registration" was released in June of 2007 by C. Perkins, E. Fogelstroem, and A. Jonsson. Using Mobile IP, a mobile node registers with its home agent each time it changes care-of address.  This document describes a new kind of "regional registrations", i.e., registrations local to the visited domain.  The regional registrations are performed via a new network entity called a Gateway Foreign Agent (GFA) and introduce a layer of hierarchy in the visited domain.  Regional registrations reduce the number of signaling messages to the home network, and reduce the signaling delay when a mobile node moves from one foreign agent to another within the same visited domain.  This document is an optional extension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4857.txt

4860	A			RFCs from 2007							"Generic Aggregate Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Reservations" was released in May of 2007 by P. Bose, F. Le Faucheur, M. Davenport, C. Christou, and B. Davie. RFC 3175 defines aggregate Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) reservations allowing resources to be reserved in a Diffserv network for a given Per Hop Behavior (PHB), or given set of PHBs, from a given source to a given destination.  RFC 3175 also defines how end-to-end RSVP reservations can be aggregated onto such aggregate reservations when transiting through a Diffserv cloud.  There are situations where multiple such aggregate reservations are needed for the same source IP address, destination IP address, and PHB (or set of PHBs).  However, this is not supported by the aggregate reservations defined in RFC 3175.  In order to support this, the present document defines a more flexible type of aggregate RSVP reservations, referred to as generic aggregate reservation.  Multiple such generic aggregate reservations can be established for a given PHB (or set of PHBs) from a given source IP address to a given destination IP address.  The generic aggregate reservations may be used to aggregate end-to-end RSVP reservations.  This document also defines the procedures for such aggregation.  The generic aggregate reservations may also be used end-to-end directly by end-systems attached to a Diffserv network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4860.txt

4863	A			RFCs from 2007							"Wildcard Pseudowire Type" was released in May of 2007 by L. Martini, and G. Swallow. Pseudowire signaling requires that the Pseudowire Type (PW Type) be identical in both directions.  For certain applications the configuration of the PW Type is most easily accomplished by configuring this information at just one PW endpoint.  In any form of LDP-based signaling, each PW endpoint must initiate the creation of a unidirectional LSP.  In order to allow the initiation of these two LSPs to remain independent, a means is needed for allowing the PW endpoint (lacking a priori knowledge of the PW Type) to initiate the creation of an LSP.  This document defines a Wildcard PW Type to satisfy this need. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4863.txt
4864	A			RFCs from 2007							"Local Network Protection for IPv6" was released in May of 2007 by E. Klein, B. Carpenter, R. Droms, G. Van de Velde, and T. Hain. Although there are many perceived benefits to Network Address Translation (NAT), its primary benefit of "amplifying" available address space is not needed in IPv6.  In addition to NAT's many serious disadvantages, there is a perception that other benefits exist, such as a variety of management and security attributes that could be useful for an Internet Protocol site.  IPv6 was designed with the intention of making NAT unnecessary, and this document shows how Local Network Protection (LNP) using IPv6 can provide the same or more benefits without the need for address translation.

This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) encoded speech signals.  The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks.  In addition, a file format is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email.  Two separate media type registrations are included, one for AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload format and the storage format.  This document obsoletes RFC 3267.

4880	A			RFCs from 2007							"OpenPGP Message Format" was released in November of 2007 by R. Thayer, H. Finney, L. Donnerhacke, D. Shaw, and J. Callas. This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary information needed to develop interoperable applications based on the OpenPGP format. It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an application. It describes only the format and methods needed to read, check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any network. It does not deal with storage and implementation questions. It does, however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid security flaws.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt
4881	A			RFCs from 2007							"Low-Latency Handoffs in Mobile IPv4" was released in June of 2007 by K. El Malki. Mobile IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform IPv4-layer handoffs between subnets served by different Foreign Agents.  In certain cases, the latency involved in these handoffs can be above the threshold required for the support of delay-sensitive or real-time services.  The aim of this document is to present two methods to achieve low-latency Mobile IPv4 handoffs.  In addition, a combination of these two methods is described.  The described techniques allow greater support for real-time services on a Mobile IPv4 network by minimizing the period of time when a Mobile Node is unable to send or receive IPv4 packets due to the delay in the Mobile IPv4 Registration process.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4881.txt

4885	A			RFCs from 2007							"Network Mobility Support Terminology" was released in July of 2007 by T. Ernst, and H-Y. Lach. This document defines a terminology for discussing network mobility (NEMO) issues and solution requirements.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4885.txt
4886	A			RFCs from 2007							"Network Mobility Support Goals and Requirements" was released in July of 2007 by T. Ernst. Network mobility arises when a router connecting a network to the Internet dynamically changes its point of attachment to the Internet thereby causing the reachability of the said network to be changed in relation to the fixed Internet topology.  Such a type of network is referred to as a mobile network.  With appropriate mechanisms, sessions established between nodes in the mobile network and the global Internet can be maintained after the mobile router changes its point of attachment.  This document outlines the goals expected from network mobility support and defines the requirements that must be met by the NEMO Basic Support solution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4886.txt
4887	A			RFCs from 2007							"Network Mobility Home Network Models" was released in July of 2007 by R. Wakikawa, V. Devarapalli, and P. Thubert. This paper documents some of the usage patterns and the associated issues when deploying a Home Network for Network Mobility (NEMO)- enabled Mobile Routers, conforming to the NEMO Basic Support.  The aim here is specifically to provide some examples of organization of the Home Network, as they were discussed in NEMO-related mailing lists.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4887.txt
4888	A			RFCs from 2007							"Network Mobility Route Optimization Problem Statement" was released in July of 2007 by C. Ng, M. Watari, F. Zhao, and P. Thubert. With current Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support, all communications to and from Mobile Network Nodes must go through the bi-directional tunnel established between the Mobile Router and Home Agent when the mobile network is away.  This sub-optimal routing results in various inefficiencies associated with packet delivery, such as increased delay and bottleneck links leading to traffic congestion, which can ultimately disrupt all communications to and from the Mobile Network Nodes.  Additionally, with nesting of Mobile Networks, these inefficiencies get compounded, and stalemate conditions may occur in specific dispositions.  This document investigates such problems and provides the motivation behind Route Optimization (RO) for NEMO.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4888.txt
4889	A			RFCs from 2007							"Network Mobility Route Optimization Solution Space Analysis" was released in July of 2007 by C. Ng, M. Watari, P. Thubert, and F. Zhao. With current Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support, all communications to and from Mobile Network Nodes must go through the Mobile Router and Home Agent (MRHA) tunnel when the mobile network is away.  This results in increased length of packet route and increased packet delay in most cases.  To overcome these limitations, one might have to turn to Route Optimization (RO) for NEMO.  This memo documents various types of Route Optimization in NEMO and explores the benefits and tradeoffs in different aspects of NEMO Route Optimization.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4889.txt
4890	A			RFCs from 2007							"Recommendations for Filtering ICMPv6 Messages in Firewalls" was released in May of 2007 by J. Mohacsi, and E. Davies. In networks supporting IPv6, the Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of functions, and a correspondingly large number of message types and options. ICMPv6 is essential to the functioning of IPv6, but there are a number of security risks associated with uncontrolled forwarding of ICMPv6 messages. Filtering strategies designed for the corresponding protocol, ICMP, in IPv4 networks are not directly applicable, because these strategies are intended to accommodate a useful auxiliary protocol that may not be required for correct functioning.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4890.txt
4891	A			RFCs from 2007							"Using IPsec to Secure IPv6-in-IPv4 Tunnels" was released in May of 2007 by H. Tschofenig, M. Parthasarathy, P. Savola, and R. Graveman. This document gives guidance on securing manually configured IPv6-in- IPv4 tunnels using IPsec in transport mode.

4892	A			RFCs from 2007							"Requirements for a Mechanism Identifying a Name Server Instance" was released in June of 2007 by S. Woolf, and D. Conrad. With the increased use of DNS anycast, load balancing, and other mechanisms allowing more than one DNS name server to share a single IP address, it is sometimes difficult to tell which of a pool of name servers has answered a particular query.  A standardized mechanism to determine the identity of a name server responding to a particular query would be useful, particularly as a diagnostic aid for administrators.  Existing ad hoc mechanisms for addressing this need have some shortcomings, not the least of which is the lack of prior analysis of exactly how such a mechanism should be designed and deployed.  This document describes the existing convention used in some widely deployed implementations of the DNS protocol, including advantages and disadvantages, and discusses some attributes of an improved mechanism.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4892.txt

This document describes common misinterpretations and some ambiguities in the Signaling Compression Protocol (SigComp), and offers guidance to developers to resolve any resultant problems.  SigComp defines a scheme for compressing messages generated by application protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This document updates the following RFCs: RFC 3320, RFC 3321, and RFC 3485. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4896.txt
4897	A			RFCs from 2007							"Handling Normative References to Standards-Track Documents" was released in June of 2007 by J. Klensin, and S. Hartman. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Request for Comments (RFC) Editor have a long-standing rule that a document at a given maturity level cannot be published until all of the documents that it references as normative are at that maturity level or higher.  This rule has sometimes resulted in very long publication delays for documents and some claims that it was a major obstruction to advancing documents in maturity level.  The IETF agreed on a way to bypass this rule with RFC 3967.  This document describes a simpler procedure for downward references to Standards-Track and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents, namely "note and move on".  The procedure in RFC 3967 still applies for downward references to other classes of documents.  In both cases, annotations should be added to such References.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4897.txt
4898	A			RFCs from 2007							"TCP Extended Statistics MIB" was released in May of 2007 by R. Raghunarayan, J. Heffner, and M. Mathis. This document describes extended performance statistics for TCP.  They are designed to use TCP's ideal vantage point to diagnose performance problems in both the network and the application.  If a network-based application is performing poorly, TCP can determine if the bottleneck is in the sender, the receiver, or the network itself.  If the bottleneck is in the network, TCP can provide specific information about its nature. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4898.txt
4901	A			RFCs from 2007							"Protocol Extensions for Header Compression over MPLS" was released in June of 2007 by A. Malis, J. Hand, and J. Ash. This specification defines how to use Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) to route Header-Compressed (HC) packets over an MPLS label switched path.  HC can significantly reduce packet-header overhead and, in combination with MPLS, can also increases bandwidth efficiency and processing scalability in terms of the maximum number of simultaneous compressed flows that use HC at each router).  Here we define how MPLS pseudowires are used to transport the HC context and control messages between the ingress and egress MPLS label switching routers.  This is defined for a specific set of existing HC mechanisms that might be used, for example, to support voice over IP.  This specification also describes extension mechanisms to allow support for future, as yet to be defined, HC protocols.  In this specification, each HC protocol operates independently over a single pseudowire instance, very much as it would over a single point-to-point link.

4902	A			RFCs from 2007							"Integrity, Privacy, and Security in Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) for SMTP" was released in May of 2007 by M. Stecher. The Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework is application agnostic. Application-specific adaptations extend that framework. Previous work has focused on HTTP and work for SMTP is in progress. These protocols differ fundamentally in the way data flows, and it turns out that existing OPES requirements and IAB considerations for OPES need to be reviewed with regards to how well they fit for SMTP adaptation. This document analyzes aspects about the integrity of SMTP and mail message adaptation by OPES systems and about privacy and security issues when the OPES framework is adapted to SMTP. It also lists requirements that must be considered when creating the "SMTP adaptation with OPES" document.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4902.txt

Uda. Multihoming technology improves the availability of host and network connectivity.  Since the behaviors of fixed and mobile networks differ, distinct architectures for each have been discussed and proposed.  This document proposes a common architecture for both mobile and fixed networking environments, using mobile IP (RFC 3775) and Network Mobility (NEMO; RFC 3963).  The proposed architecture requires a modification of mobile IP and NEMO so that multiple Care-of Addresses (CoAs) can be used.  In addition, multiple Home Agents (HAs) that are located in different places are required for redundancy.

4910	A			RFCs from 2007							"Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER) for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)" was released in July of 2007 by D. Prager, and S. Legg. This document defines a set of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) encoding rules, called the Robust XML Encoding Rules or RXER, that produce an Extensible Markup Language (XML) representation for values of any given ASN.1 data type.  Rules for producing a canonical RXER encoding are also defined.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4910.txt
4911	A			RFCs from 2007							"Encoding Instructions for the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER)" was released in July of 2007 by S. Legg. This document defines encoding instructions that may be used in an Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) specification to alter how ASN.1 values are encoded by the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER) and Canonical Robust XML Encoding Rules (CRXER), for example, to encode a component of an ASN.1 value as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) attribute rather than as a child element.  Some of these encoding instructions also affect how an ASN.1 specification is translated into an Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) specification.  Encoding instructions that allow an ASN.1 specification to reference definitions in other XML schema languages are also defined.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4911.txt
4912	A			RFCs from 2007							"Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X)" was released in July of 2007 by S. Legg. Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) is a semantically equivalent Extensible Markup Language (XML) representation for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) specifications.  ASN.X completely avoids the numerous ambiguities inherent in the ASN.1 language; therefore, specifications written in ASN.X are much easier to parse and manage than original ASN.1 specifications.  ASN.X, together with the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER), constitutes a schema language for XML documents that offers, through other ASN.1 encoding rules, alternative compact binary encodings for XML instance documents.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4912.txt
4913	A			RFCs from 2007							"Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) Representation of Encoding Instructions for the Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER)" was released in July of 2007 by S. Legg.

This document describes an extension to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) in order to define independent IP topologies called Multi- Topologies (MTs). The Multi-Topologies extension can be used for computing different paths for unicast traffic, multicast traffic, different classes of service based on flexible criteria, or an in- band network management topology.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4915.txt
4916	A			RFCs from 2007							"Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in June of 2007 by J. Elwell. This document provides a means for a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) that receives a dialog-forming request to supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the reverse direction, and for that identity to be signed by an Authentication Service.  Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the UA that receives it (the User Agent Server, UAS) can have a different identity from that in the To header field.  The same mechanism can be used to indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some action in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a gateway.  This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4916.txt

In a distributed, constraint-based routing environment, the information used to compute a path may be out of date. This means that Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) setup requests may be blocked by links or nodes without sufficient resources. Crankback is a scheme whereby setup failure information is returned from the point of failure to allow new setup attempts to be made avoiding the blocked resources. Crankback can also be applied to LSP recovery to indicate the location of the failed link or node.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4920.txt

4927	A			RFCs from 2007							"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCECP) Specific Requirements for Inter-Area MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering" was released in June of 2007 by J.-L. Le Roux. For scalability purposes, a network may comprise multiple Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas.  An inter-area Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) is an LSP that transits through at least two IGP areas.  In a multi-area network, topology visibility remains local to a given area, and a head-end Label Switching Router (LSR) cannot compute an inter-area shortest constrained path.  One key application of the Path Computation Element (PCE)-based architecture is the computation of inter-area TE-LSP paths.  The PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP) is used to communicate computation requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to PCEs, and to return computed paths in responses.  This document lists a detailed set of PCECP-specific requirements for support of inter-area TE-LSP path computation.  It complements the generic requirements for a PCE Communication Protocol.

This document makes best practice recommendations for anyone defining an application to run over an MPLS network that wishes to avoid the reordering that can result from transmission of different packets from the same flow over multiple different equal cost paths.  These recommendations rely on inspection of the IP version number field in packets.  Despite the heuristic nature of the recommendations, they provide a relatively safe way to operate MPLS networks, even if future allocations of IP version numbers were made for some purpose.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4928.txt

4941	A			RFCs from 2007							"Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6" was released in September of 2007 by T. Narten, R. Draves, and S. Krishnan. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+3041">RFC 3041</a>. Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random number generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.

4943	A			RFCs from 2007							"IPv6 Neighbor Discovery On-Link Assumption Considered Harmful" was released in September of 2007 by S. Roy, J. Paugh, and A. Durand. This document describes the historical and background information behind the removal of the "on-link assumption" from the conceptual host sending algorithm defined in Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6).  According to the algorithm as originally described, when a host's default router list is empty, the host assumes that all destinations are on-link.  This is particularly problematic with IPv6-capable nodes that do not have off-link IPv6 connectivity (e.g., no default router).  This document describes how making this assumption causes problems and how these problems outweigh the benefits of this part of the conceptual sending algorithm.

4951	A			RFCs from 2007							"Fail Over Extensions for Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) "failover"" was released in August of 2007 by V. Jain. Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a connection-oriented protocol that has a shared state between active endpoints.  Some of this shared state is vital for operation, but may be volatile in nature, such as packet sequence numbers used on the L2TP Control Connection.  When failure of one side of a control connection occurs, a new control connection is created and associated with the old connection by exchanging information about the old connection.  Such a mechanism is not intended as a replacement for an active fail over with some mirrored connection states, but as an aid for those parameters that are particularly difficult to have immediately available.  Protocol extensions to L2TP defined in this document are intended to facilitate state recovery, providing additional resiliency in an L2TP network, and improving a remote system's layer 2 connectivity.

4953	A			RFCs from 2007							"Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks" was released in July of 2007 by J. Touch. Recent analysis of potential attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicates an increased vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs), sent with forged IP source addresses (spoofing).  TCP has always been susceptible to such RST spoofing attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking that the RST sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as via the obfuscation of TCP endpoint and port numbers.  For pairs of well-known endpoints often over predictable port pairs, such as BGP or between web servers and well-known large-scale caches, increases in the path bandwidth-delay product of a connection have sufficiently increased the receive window space that off-path third parties can brute-force generate a viable RST sequence number.  The susceptibility to attack increases with the square of the bandwidth, and thus presents a significant vulnerability for recent high-speed networks.  This document addresses this vulnerability, discussing proposed solutions at the transport level and their inherent challenges, as well as existing network level solutions and the feasibility of their deployment.  This document focuses on vulnerabilities due to spoofed TCP segments, and includes a discussion of related ICMP spoofing attacks on TCP connections.

The guidance is also useful to designers of systems and solutions that include AAA key management protocols.  Given the complexity and difficulty in designing secure, long-lasting key management algorithms and protocols by experts in the field, it is almost certainly inappropriate for IETF working groups without deep expertise in the area to be designing their own key management algorithms and protocols based on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols.  The guidelines in this document apply to documents requesting publication as IETF RFCs.

The setup of a full mesh of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR) is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute.  Such deployment may require the configuration of a potentially large number of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number of LSRs).  This document specifies Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such mesh of TE LSPs.

4973	A			RFCs from 2007							"OSPF-xTE: Experimental Extension to OSPF for Traffic Engineering" was released in July of 2007 by P. Joseph, and P. Srisuresh. This document defines OSPF-xTE, an experimental traffic engineering (TE) extension to the link-state routing protocol OSPF.  OSPF-xTE defines new TE Link State Advertisements (LSAs) to disseminate TE metrics within an autonomous System (AS), which may consist of multiple areas.  When an AS consists of TE and non-TE nodes, OSPF-xTE ensures that non-TE nodes in the AS are unaffected by the TE LSAs.  OSPF-xTE generates a stand-alone TE Link State Database (TE-LSDB), distinct from the native OSPF LSDB, for computation of TE circuit paths.  OSPF-xTE is versatile and extendible to non-packet networks such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) / Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and optical networks.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4973.txt

4976	A			RFCs from 2007							"Relay Extensions for the Message Sessions Relay Protocol (MSRP)" was released in September of 2007 by R. Mahy, C. Jennings, and A. B. Roach. Two separate models for conveying instant messages have been defined.  Page-mode messages stand alone and are not part of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) session, whereas session-mode messages are set up as part of a session using SIP.  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is a protocol for near real-time, peer-to-peer exchanges of binary content without intermediaries, which is designed to be signaled using a separate rendezvous protocol such as SIP.  This document introduces the notion of message relay intermediaries to MSRP and describes the extensions necessary to use them. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4976.txt

5001	A			RFCs from 2007							"DNS Name Server Identifier (NSID) Option" was released in August of 2007 by R. Austein. With the increased use of DNS anycast, load balancing, and other mechanisms allowing more than one DNS name server to share a single IP address, it is sometimes difficult to tell which of a pool of name servers has answered a particular query.  While existing ad-hoc mechanisms allow an operator to send follow-up queries when it is necessary to debug such a configuration, the only completely reliable way to obtain the identity of the name server that responded is to have the name server include this information in the response itself.  This note defines a protocol extension to support this functionality. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5001.txt

5014	A			RFCs from 2007							"IPv6 Socket API for Source Address Selection" was released in September of 2007 by J. Laganier, S. Chakrabarti, and E. Nordmark. The IPv6 default address selection document (RFC 3484) describes the rules for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and indicates that applications should be able to reverse the sense of some of the address selection rules through some unspecified API.  However, no such socket API exists in the basic (RFC 3493) or advanced (RFC 3542) IPv6 socket API documents.  This document fills that gap partially by specifying new socket-level options for source address selection and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify address selection based on the source address preference in accordance with the socket-level options that modify the default source address selection algorithm.  The socket API described in this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications that want to use the care-of address for communication.  It also specifies socket options and flags for selecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA source addresses.

5015	A			RFCs from 2007							"Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (BIDIR-PIM)" was released in October of 2007 by I. Kouvelas, L. Vicisano, T. Speakman, and M. Handley. This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources and receivers.  Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events.

Authorization policies, also known as authorization rules, specify what presence information can be given to which watchers, and when.  This specification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format for expressing presence authorization rules.  Such a document can be manipulated by clients using the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP), although other techniques are permitted. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5025.txt
5026	A			RFCs from 2007							"Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in Split Scenario" was released in October of 2007 by V. Devarapalli, G. Giaretta, and J. Kempf. A Mobile IPv6 node requires a Home Agent address, a home address, and IPsec security associations with its Home Agent before it can start utilizing Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these are statically configured.  This document defines how a Mobile IPv6 node can bootstrap this information from non-topological information and security credentials pre-configured on the Mobile Node.  The solution defined in this document solves the split scenario described in the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement in RFC 4640.  The split scenario refers to the case where the Mobile Node's mobility service is authorized by a different service provider than basic network access.  The solution described in this document is also generically applicable to any bootstrapping case, since other scenarios are more specific realizations of the split scenario.

IMAP SEARCH returns messages whose internal date is within or outside a specified interval.  The mechanism described here, OLDER and YOUNGER, differs from BEFORE and SINCE in that the client specifies an interval, rather than a date.  WITHIN is useful for persistent searches where either the device does not have the capacity to perform the search at regular intervals or the network is of limited bandwidth and thus there is a desire to reduce network traffic from sending repeated requests and redundant responses.

5033	A			RFCs from 2007							"Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms" was released in August of 2007 by M. Allman, and S. Floyd. The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks).  Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles.  Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5033.txt

The architecture for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is described in RFC 3031.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

5038	A			RFCs from 2007							"The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Implementation Survey Results" was released in October of 2007 by L. Andersson, and B. Thomas. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), described in RFC 3031, is a method for forwarding packets that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets, called labels, to determine packet next hops.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a Label Distribution Protocol (as described in RFC 3036) , by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  One such protocol, called LDP, is used by LSRs to distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.  This document reports on a survey of LDP implementations conducted in August 2002 as part of the process of advancing LDP from Proposed to Draft Standard.

5039	A			RFCs from 2008							"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Spam" was released in January of 2008 by J. Rosenberg, and C. Jennings. Spam, defined as the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages, has plagued Internet email.  Unfortunately, spam is not limited to email.  It can affect any system that enables user-to-user communications.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defines a system for user-to- user multimedia communications.  Therefore, it is susceptible to spam, just as email is.  In this document, we analyze the problem of spam in SIP.  We first identify the ways in which the problem is the same and the ways in which it is different from email.  We then examine the various possible solutions that have been discussed for email and consider their applicability to SIP.

This document defines a Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP) that operates over the Direct Data Placement Protocol (DDP protocol).  RDMAP provides read and write services directly to applications and enables data to be transferred directly into Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) Buffers without intermediate data copies.  It also enables a kernel bypass implementation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5040.txt
5041	A			RFCs from 2007							"Direct Data Placement over Reliable Transports" was released in October of 2007 by H. Shah, P. Culley, R. Recio, and J. Pinkerton.

This removes excess CPU and memory utilization associated with transferring data through the intermediate buffers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5041.txt
5042	A			RFCs from 2007							"Direct Data Placement Protocol (DDP) / Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP) Security" was released in October of 2007 by J. Pinkerton, and E. Deleganes. This document analyzes security issues around implementation and use of the Direct Data Placement Protocol (DDP) and Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP).  It first defines an architectural model for an RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC), which can implement DDP or RDMAP and DDP.  The document reviews various attacks against the resources defined in the architectural model and the countermeasures that can be used to protect the system.  Attacks are grouped into those that can be mitigated by using secure communication channels across the network, attacks from Remote Peers, and attacks from Local Peers.  Attack categories include spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5042.txt

Marker PDU Aligned Framing (MPA) is designed to work as an "adaptation layer" between TCP and the Direct Data Placement protocol (DDP) as described in RFC 5041.  It preserves the reliable, in-order delivery of TCP, while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries that DDP requires.  MPA is fully compliant with applicable TCP RFCs and can be utilized with existing TCP implementations.  MPA also supports integrated implementations that combine TCP, MPA and DDP to reduce buffering requirements in the implementation and improve performance at the system level.

5046	A			RFCs from 2007							"Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) Extensions for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)" was released in October of 2007 by H. Shah, M. Chadalapaka, P. Thaler, J. Hufferd, U. Elzur, and M. Ko. Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) Extensions for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) provides the RDMA data transfer capability to iSCSI by layering iSCSI on top of an RDMA-Capable Protocol, such as the iWARP protocol suite.  An RDMA-Capable Protocol provides RDMA Read and Write services, which enable data to be transferred directly into SCSI I/O Buffers without intermediate data copies.  This document describes the extensions to the iSCSI protocol to support RDMA services as provided by an RDMA-Capable Protocol, such as the iWARP protocol suite.

5047	A			RFCs from 2007							"DA: Datamover Architecture for the Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)" was released in October of 2007 by H. Shah, M. Chadalapaka, J. Hufferd, and J. Satran. The Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of application protocols onto TCP/IP.  Datamover Architecture for iSCSI (DA) defines an abstract model in which the movement of data between iSCSI end nodes is logically separated from the rest of the iSCSI protocol in order to allow iSCSI to adapt to innovations available in new IP transports.  While DA defines the architectural functions required of the class of Datamover protocols, it does not define any specific Datamover protocols.  Each such Datamover protocol, defined in a separate document, provides a reliable transport for all iSCSI PDUs, but actually moves the data required for certain iSCSI PDUs without involving the remote iSCSI layer itself.  This document begins with an introduction of a few new abstractions, defines a layered architecture for iSCSI and Datamover protocols, and then models the interactions within an iSCSI end node between the iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer that happen in order to transparently perform remote data movement within an IP fabric.  It is intended that this definition will help map iSCSI to generic Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable IP fabrics in the future comprising TCP, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), and possibly other underlying network transport layers, such as InfiniBand.

This document describes how to use Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for bulk data transfer over IP multicast.  This document defines a framework for the definition of the information that needs to be communicated in order to use an FEC code for bulk data transfer, in addition to the encoded data itself, and for definition of formats and codes for communication of that information.  Both information communicated with the encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band' are considered.  The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  The requirements on Content Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework are also defined.  The companion document titled "The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast" describes some applications of FEC codes for delivering content.  This document obsoletes RFC 3452.

The Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) allows a client to delegate certification path construction and certification path validation to a server.  The path construction or validation (e.g., making sure that none of the certificates in the path are revoked) is performed according to a validation policy, which contains one or more trust anchors.  It allows simplification of client implementations and use of a set of predefined validation policies. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5055.txt
5056	A			RFCs from 2007							"On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels" was released in November of 2007 by N. Williams. The concept of channel binding allows applications to establish that the two end-points of a secure channel at one network layer are the same as at a higher layer by binding authentication at the higher layer to the channel at the lower layer. This allows applications to delegate session protection to lower layers, which has various performance benefits.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5056.txt

Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can create an association between endpoints known as a dialog. Some of these methods can also create a different, but related, association within an existing dialog. These multiple associations, or dialog usages, require carefully coordinated processing as they have independent life-cycles, but share common dialog state. Processing multiple dialog usages correctly is not completely understood. What is understood is difficult to implement.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5057.txt

While traditional IP multicast schemes (RFC 1112) are scalable for very large multicast groups, they have scalability issues with a very large number of distinct multicast groups. This document describes Xcast (Explicit Multi-unicast), a new multicast scheme with complementary scaling properties: Xcast supports a very large number of small multicast sessions. Xcast achieves this by explicitly encoding the list of destinations in the data packets, instead of using a multicast group address.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5058.txt

It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2362">RFC 2362</a>. This document specifies the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for the class of multicast routing protocols in the PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) family that use the concept of a Rendezvous Point as a means for receivers to discover the sources that send to a particular multicast group.  BSR is one way that a multicast router can learn the set of group-to-RP mappings required in order to function.  The mechanism is dynamic, largely self-configuring, and robust to router failure.

5087	A			RFCs from 2007							"Time Division Multiplexing over IP (TDMoIP)" was released in December of 2007 by M. Anavi, R. Insler, R. Shashoua, and Y(J). Stein. Time Division Multiplexing over IP (TDMoIP) is a structure-aware method for transporting Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) signals using pseudowires (PWs).  Being structure-aware, TDMoIP is able to ensure TDM structure integrity, and thus withstand network degradations better than structure-agnostic transport.  Structure-aware methods can distinguish individual channels, enabling packet loss concealment and bandwidth conservation.  Accessibility of TDM signaling facilitates mechanisms that exploit or manipulate signaling.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5087.txt

This document specifies a payload format for generic Forward Error Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format described in this document allows end systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.  It enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.  This scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers in a multicast group that do not implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring the protection data.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The FEC specified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.

5112	A			RFCs from 2008							"The Presence-Specific Static Dictionary for Signaling Compression (Sigcomp)" was released in January of 2008 by M. Garcia-Martin. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a text-based protocol for initiating and managing communication sessions.  The protocol is extended by the SIP-events notification framework to provide subscriptions and notifications of SIP events.  One example of such event notification mechanism is presence, which is expressed in XML documents called presence documents.  SIP can be compressed by using Signaling Compression (SigComp), which is enhanced by using the SIP/ Session Description Protocol (SDP) dictionary to achieve better compression rates.  However, the SIP/SDP dictionary is not able to increase the compression factor of (typically lengthy) presence documents.  This memo defines the presence-specific static dictionary that SigComp can use in order to compress presence documents to achieve higher efficiency.

5127	A			RFCs from 2008							"Aggregation of Diffserv Service Classes" was released in February of 2008 by K. Chan, F. Baker, and J. Babiarz. In the core of a high-capacity network, service differentiation may still be needed to support applications' utilization of the network.  Applications with similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements are mapped into Diffserv service classes based on end- to-end behavior requirements of the applications.  However, some network segments may be configured in such a way that a single forwarding treatment may satisfy the traffic characteristics and performance requirements of two or more service classes.  In these cases, it may be desirable to aggregate two or more Diffserv service classes into a single forwarding treatment.  This document provides guidelines for the aggregation of Diffserv service classes into forwarding treatments.

5136	A			RFCs from 2008							"Defining Network Capacity" was released in February of 2008 by J. Ishac, and P. Chimento. Measuring capacity is a task that sounds simple, but in reality can be quite complex.  In addition, the lack of a unified nomenclature on this subject makes it increasingly difficult to properly build, test, and use techniques and tools built around these constructs.  This document provides definitions for the terms 'Capacity' and 'Available Capacity' related to IP traffic traveling between a source and destination in an IP network.  By doing so, we hope to provide a common framework for the discussion and analysis of a diverse set of current and future estimation techniques.

5137	A			RFCs from 2008							"ASCII Escaping of Unicode Characters" was released in February of 2008 by J. Klensin. There are a number of circumstances in which an escape mechanism is needed in conjunction with a protocol to encode characters that cannot be represented or transmitted directly.  With ASCII coding, the traditional escape has been either the decimal or hexadecimal numeric value of the character, written in a variety of different ways.  The move to Unicode, where characters occupy two or more octets and may be coded in several different forms, has further complicated the question of escapes.  This document discusses some options now in use and discusses considerations for selecting one for use in new IETF protocols, and protocols that are now being internationalized.

5164	A			RFCs from 2008							"Mobility Services Transport: Problem Statement" was released in March of 2008 by T. Melia. There are ongoing activities in the networking community to develop solutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous wired and wireless access systems including, but not limited to, IEEE 802.21.  Intelligent access selection, taking into account link-layer attributes, requires the delivery of a variety of different information types to the terminal from different sources within the network and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements for this signalling have both transport and security issues that must be considered.  The signalling must not be constrained to specific link types, so there is at least a common component to the signalling problem, which is within the scope of the IETF.  This document presents a problem statement for this core problem.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5164.txt

5184	A			RFCs from 2008							"Unified Layer 2 (L2) Abstractions for Layer 3 (L3)-Driven Fast Handover" was released in May of 2008 by K. Gogo, F. Teraoka, K. Mitsuya, K. Mitani, and R. Shibui. This document proposes unified Layer 2 (L2) abstractions for Layer 3 (L3)-driven fast handovers.  For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol layer to know or utilize other layers' information, such as the form of L2 triggers.  However, each protocol layer is basically designed independently.  Since each protocol layer is also implemented independently in current operating systems, it is very hard to exchange control information between protocol layers.  This document defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of "primitives" to achieve fast handovers in the network layer as a means of solving the problem.  This mechanism is called "L3-driven fast handovers" because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using the primitives.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5184.txt

5195	A			RFCs from 2008							"BGP-Based Auto-Discovery for Layer-1 VPNs" was released in June of 2008 by Y. Rekhter, D. Fedyk, and H. Ould-Brahim. The purpose of this document is to define a BGP-based auto-discovery mechanism for Layer-1 VPNs (L1VPNs).  The auto-discovery mechanism for L1VPNs allows the provider network devices to dynamically discover the set of Provider Edges (PEs) having ports attached to Customer Edge (CE) members of the same VPN.  That information is necessary for completing the signaling phase of L1VPN connections.  One main objective of a L1VPN auto-discovery mechanism is to support the "single-end provisioning" model, where addition of a new port to a given L1VPN would involve configuration changes only on the PE that has this port and on the CE that is connected to the PE via this port.

This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a Sigma-compliant Diffie- Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper- layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.

This document defines mobility and multihoming extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general "LOCATOR" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached.  This document also defines elements of procedure for mobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes the primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same LOCATOR parameter can also be used to support end-host multihoming, detailed procedures are left for further study.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5206.txt
5207	A			RFCs from 2008							"NAT and Firewall Traversal Issues of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Communication" was released in April of 2008 by M. Stiemerling, L. Eggert, and J. Quittek. The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These "middleboxes" are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.  It identifies and discusses issues in the current HIP specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes.  This document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.

This document defines the problem statement, scope, and protocol requirements between the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) reference model.  NEA provides owners of networks (e.g., an enterprise offering remote access) a mechanism to evaluate the posture of a system.  This may take place during the request for network access and/or subsequently at any time while connected to the network.  The learned posture information can then be applied to a variety of compliance-oriented decisions.  The posture information is frequently useful for detecting systems that are lacking or have out-of-date security protection mechanisms such as: anti-virus and host-based firewall software.  In order to provide context for the requirements, a reference model and terminology are introduced.

It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2434">RFC 2434</a>. Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5226.txt
5227	A			RFCs from 2008							"IPv4 Address Conflict Detection" was released in July of 2008 by S. Cheshire. When two hosts on the same link attempt to use the same IPv4 address at the same time (except in rare special cases where this has been arranged by prior coordination), problems ensue for one or both hosts.  This document describes (i) a simple precaution that a host can take in advance to help prevent this misconfiguration from happening, and (ii) if this misconfiguration does occur, a simple mechanism by which a host can passively detect, after the fact, that it has happened, so that the host or administrator may respond to rectify the problem.

For example, this can be used to attach comments and other useful information to a message. It is also possible to attach annotations to specific parts of a message, so that, for example, they could be marked as seen, or important, or a comment added.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5257.txt
5258	A			RFCs from 2008							"Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 - LIST Command Extensions" was released in June of 2008 by A. Melnikov, and B. Leiba. IMAP4 has two commands for listing mailboxes: LIST and LSUB.  As we have added extensions, such as Mailbox Referrals, that have required specialized lists we have had to expand the number of list commands, since each extension must add its function to both LIST and LSUB, and these commands are not, as they are defined, extensible.  If we've needed the extensions to work together, we've had to add a set of commands to mix the different options, the set increasing in size with each new extension.  This document describes an extension to the base LIST command that will allow these additions to be done with mutually compatible options to the LIST command, avoiding the exponential increase in specialized list commands.

5261	A			RFCs from 2008							"An Extensible Markup Language (XML) Patch Operations Framework Utilizing XML Path Language (XPath) Selectors" was released in September of 2008 by J. Urpalainen. Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents are widely used as containers for the exchange and storage of arbitrary data in today's systems.  In order to send changes to an XML document, an entire copy of the new version must be sent, unless there is a means of indicating only the portions that have changed.  This document describes an XML patch framework utilizing XML Path language (XPath) selectors.  These selector values and updated new data content constitute the basis of patch operations described in this document.  In addition to them, with basic &lt;add&gt;, &lt;replace&gt;, and &lt;remove&gt; directives a set of patches can then be applied to update an existing XML document.

5262	A			RFCs from 2008							"Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) Extension for Partial Presence" was released in September of 2008 by E. Leppanen, M. Lonnfors, H. Khartabil, and J. Urpalainen. The Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) specifies the baseline XML-based format for describing presence information.  One of the characteristics of the PIDF is that the document always needs to carry all presence information available for the presentity.  In some environments where low bandwidth and high latency links can exist, it is often beneficial to limit the amount of transported information over the network.  This document introduces a new MIME type that enables transporting of either only the changed parts or the full PIDF-based presence information.

5263	A			RFCs from 2008							"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Partial Notification of Presence Information" was released in September of 2008 by E. Leppanen, M. Lonnfors, H. Khartabil, and J. Costa-Requena. By default, presence delivered using the presence event package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is represented in the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF).  A PIDF document contains a set of elements, each representing a different aspect of the presence being reported.  When any subset of the elements change, even just a single element, a new document containing the full set of elements is delivered.  This memo defines an extension allowing delivery of only the presence data that has actually changed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5263.txt
5264	A			RFCs from 2008							"Publication of Partial Presence Information" was released in September of 2008 by E. Leppanen, M. Lonnfors, and A. Niemi. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication describes a mechanism with which a presence user agent is able to publish presence information to a presence agent.  Using the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF), each presence publication contains full state, regardless of how much of that information has actually changed since the previous update.  As a consequence, updating a sizeable presence document with small changes bears a considerable overhead and is therefore inefficient.  Especially with low bandwidth and high latency links, this can constitute a considerable burden to the system.  This memo defines a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constraints and increases transport efficiency by introducing a mechanism that allows for publication of partial presence information.

Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when they roam and connect to the services offered in the enterprise.  Secure connectivity is required when the user connects to the enterprise from an untrusted network.  Mobility is beneficial when the user moves, either inside or outside the enterprise network, and acquires a new IP address.  This document describes a solution using Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide secure connectivity and mobility.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5266.txt

5268	A			RFCs from 2008							"Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers" was released in June of 2008 by R. Koodli. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+4068">RFC 4068</a> and is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+5568">RFC 5568</a>. Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node (MN) to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover.  During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This "handover latency" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding Update, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP).  Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the link switching latency.

5269	A			RFCs from 2008							"Distributing a Symmetric Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) Handover Key Using SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)" was released in June of 2008 by R. Koodli, and J. Kempf. Fast Mobile IPv6 requires that a Fast Binding Update is secured using a security association shared between an Access Router and a Mobile Node in order to avoid certain attacks.  In this document, a method for provisioning a shared key from the Access Router to the Mobile Node is defined to protect this signaling.  The Mobile Node generates a public/private key pair using the same public key algorithm as for SEND (RFC 3971).  The Mobile Node sends the public key to the Access Router.  The Access Router encrypts a shared handover key using the public key and sends it back to the Mobile Node.  The Mobile Node decrypts the shared handover key using the matching private key, and the handover key is then available for generating an authenticator on a Fast Binding Update.  The Mobile Node and Access Router use the Router Solicitation for Proxy Advertisement and Proxy Router Advertisement from Fast Mobile IPv6 for the key exchange.  The key exchange messages are required to have SEND security; that is, the source address is a Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) and the messages are signed using the CGA private key of the sending node.  This allows the Access Router, prior to providing the shared handover key, to verify the authorization of the Mobile Node to claim the address so that the previous care-of CGA in the Fast Binding Update can act as the name of the key.

This document describes how a Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover can be implemented on link layers conforming to the IEEE 802.16e suite of specifications.  The proposed scheme tries to achieve seamless handover by exploiting the link-layer handover indicators and thereby synchronizing the IEEE 802.16e handover procedures with the Mobile IPv6 fast handover procedures efficiently.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5270.txt
5271	A			RFCs from 2008							"Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers for 3G CDMA Networks" was released in June of 2008 by H. Yokota, and G. Dommety. Mobile IPv6 is designed to maintain its connectivity while moving from one network to another.  It is adopted in 3G CDMA networks as a way to maintain connectivity when the mobile node (MN) moves between access routers.  However, this handover procedure requires not only movement detection by the MN, but also the acquisition of a new Care-of Address and Mobile IPv6 registration with the new care-of address before the traffic can be sent or received in the target network.  During this period, packets destined for the mobile node may be lost, which may not be acceptable for a real-time application such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video telephony.  This document specifies fast handover methods in the 3G CDMA networks in order to reduce latency and packet loss during handover.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5271.txt

This document describes a mechanism to manage (i.e., set up, distribute, and rekey) keys used with symmetric cryptographic algorithms.  Also defined herein is a mechanism to organize users into groups to support distribution of encrypted content using symmetric cryptographic algorithms.  The mechanism uses the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protocol and Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) protocol to manage the symmetric keys.  Any member of the group can then later use this distributed shared key to decrypt other CMS encrypted objects with the symmetric key.  This mechanism has been developed to support Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Mail List Agents (MLAs). [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5275.txt
5276	A			RFCs from 2008							"Using the Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) to Convey Long-Term Evidence Records" was released in August of 2008 by C. Wallace. The Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) defines an extensible means of delegating the development and validation of certification paths to a server.  It can be used to support the development and validation of certification paths well after the expiration of the certificates in the path by specifying a time of interest in the past.  The Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) defines structures, called evidence records, to support the non-repudiation of the existence of data.  Evidence records can be used to preserve materials that comprise a certification path such that trust in the certificates can be established after the expiration of the certificates in the path and after the cryptographic algorithms used to sign the certificates in the path are no longer secure.  This document describes usage of the SCVP WantBack feature to convey evidence records, enabling SCVP responders to provide preservation evidence for certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).

5281	A			RFCs from 2008							"Extensible Authentication Protocol Tunneled Transport Layer Security Authenticated Protocol Version 0 (EAP-TTLSv0)" was released in August of 2008 by P. Funk, and S. Blake-Wilson. EAP-TTLS is an EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) method that encapsulates a TLS (Transport Layer Security) session, consisting of a handshake phase and a data phase.  During the handshake phase, the server is authenticated to the client (or client and server are mutually authenticated) using standard TLS procedures, and keying material is generated in order to create a cryptographically secure tunnel for information exchange in the subsequent data phase.  During the data phase, the client is authenticated to the server (or client and server are mutually authenticated) using an arbitrary authentication mechanism encapsulated within the secure tunnel.  The encapsulated authentication mechanism may itself be EAP, or it may be another authentication protocol such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, or MS-CHAP-V2.  Thus, EAP-TTLS allows legacy password-based authentication protocols to be used against existing authentication databases, while protecting the security of these legacy protocols against eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and other attacks.  The data phase may also be used for additional, arbitrary data exchange.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5281.txt

5286	A			RFCs from 2008							"Basic Specification for IP Fast Reroute: Loop-Free Alternates" was released in September of 2008 by A. Atlas, and A. Zinin. This document describes the use of loop-free alternates to provide local protection for unicast traffic in pure IP and MPLS/LDP networks in the event of a single failure, whether link, node, or shared risk link group (SRLG).  The goal of this technology is to reduce the packet loss that happens while routers converge after a topology change due to a failure.  Rapid failure repair is achieved through use of precalculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to use until the distributed network convergence process completes.  This simple approach does not require any support from other routers.  The extent to which this goal can be met by this specification is dependent on the topology of the network.

This document presents some observations on "simple best-effort traffic", defined loosely for the purposes of this document as Internet traffic that is not covered by Quality of Service (QOS) mechanisms, congestion-based pricing, cost-based fairness, admissions control, or the like.  One observation is that simple best-effort traffic serves a useful role in the Internet, and is worth keeping.  While differential treatment of traffic can clearly be useful, we believe such mechanisms are useful as *adjuncts* to simple best- effort traffic, not as *replacements* of simple best-effort traffic.  A second observation is that for simple best-effort traffic, some form of rough flow-rate fairness is a useful goal for resource allocation, where "flow-rate fairness" is defined by the goal of equal flow rates for different flows over the same path.

Vasseur, A. Bonda, K. Kumaki, and M. Meyer. Several Link-type sub-Type-Length-Values (sub-TLVs) have been defined for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE), in order to advertise some link characteristics such as the available bandwidth, traffic engineering metric, administrative group, and so on.  By making statistical assumptions about the aggregated traffic carried onto a set of TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) signalled with zero bandwidth (referred to as "unconstrained TE LSP" in this document), algorithms can be designed to load balance (existing or newly configured) unconstrained TE LSP across a set of equal cost paths.  This requires knowledge of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link.  This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering sub-TLV used to advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link.

5332	A			RFCs from 2008							"MPLS Multicast Encapsulations" was released in August of 2008 by R. Aggarwal, Y. Rekhter, E. Rosen, and T. Eckert. RFC 3032 established two data link layer codepoints for MPLS, used to distinguish whether the data link layer frame is carrying an MPLS unicast or an MPLS multicast packet. However, this usage was never deployed. This specification updates RFC 3032 by redefining the meaning of these two codepoints. Both codepoints can now be used to carry multicast packets. The second codepoint (formerly the "multicast codepoint") is now to be used only on multiaccess media, and it is to mean "the top label of the following label stack is an upstream-assigned label".	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5332.txt

Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the capabilities to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected information in specific header fields, and to use non-ASCII characters in envelope addresses.  It also requires being able to express those addresses and the information based on them in mail header fields.  This document specifies an experimental variant of Internet mail that permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header field.  This form is permitted in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP extension, as specified in an associated specification.  This specification Updates section 6.4 of RFC 2045 to conform with the requirements.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5335.txt

It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+6533">RFC 6533</a>. Delivery status notifications (DSNs) are critical to the correct operation of an email system. However, the existing Draft Standards (RFC 3461, RFC 3462, RFC 3464) are presently limited to US-ASCII text in the machine-readable portions of the protocol. This specification adds a new address type for international email addresses so an original recipient address with non-US-ASCII characters can be correctly preserved even after downgrading. This also provides updated content return media types for delivery status notifications and message disposition notifications to support use of the new address type.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5337.txt

This document is an informative overview of how legacy applications can be made to work with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP proposes to add a cryptographic name space for network stack names.  From an application viewpoint, HIP-enabled systems support a new address family of host identifiers, but it may be a long time until such HIP-aware applications are widely deployed even if host systems are upgraded.  This informational document discusses implementation and Application Programming Interface (API) issues relating to using HIP in situations in which the system is HIP-aware but the applications are not, and is intended to aid implementors and early adopters in thinking about and locally solving systems issues regarding the incremental deployment of HIP.

This document describes the modifications to OSPF to support version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). The fundamental mechanisms of OSPF (flooding, Designated Router (DR) election, area support, Short Path First (SPF) calculations, etc.) remain unchanged. However, some changes have been necessary, either due to changes in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6, or simply to handle the increased address size of IPv6. These modifications will necessitate incrementing the protocol version from version 2 to version 3.

5352	A			RFCs from 2008							"Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP)" was released in September of 2008 by R. Stewart, M. Tuexen, M. Stillman, and Q. Xie. Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP; RFC 5352), in conjunction with the Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP; RFC 5353), provides a high-availability data transfer mechanism over IP networks. ASAP uses a handle-based addressing model that isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es), which normally constitutes a single point of failure.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5352.txt

5364	A			RFCs from 2008							"Extensible Markup Language (XML) Format Extension for Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists" was released in October of 2008 by G. Camarillo, and M. Garcia-Martin. In certain types of multimedia communications, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request is distributed to a group of SIP User Agents (UAs).  The sender sends a single SIP request to a server which further distributes the request to the group.  This SIP request contains a list of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which identify the recipients of the SIP request.  This URI list is expressed as a resource list XML document.  This specification defines an XML extension to the XML resource list format that allows the sender of the request to qualify a recipient with a copy control level similar to the copy control level of existing email systems.

5367	A			RFCs from 2008							"Subscriptions to Request-Contained Resource Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in October of 2008 by G. Camarillo, O. Levin, and A.B. Roach. This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of resources in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of resources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually, the subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets notifications about changes in the resources' states using a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5367.txt
5368	A			RFCs from 2008							"Referring to Multiple Resources in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in October of 2008 by M. Isomaki, H. Khartabil, A. Niemi, G. Camarillo, and M.

5373	A			RFCs from 2008							"Requesting Answering Modes for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in November of 2008 by D. Willis, and A. Allen. This document extends SIP with two header fields and associated option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the requester's preference for user-interface handling related to answering of that request.  The first header, "Answer-Mode", expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface waits for user input before accepting the request or, instead, accepts the request without waiting on user input.  The second header, "Priv-Answer-Mode", is similar to the first, except that it requests administrative-level access and has consequent additional authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have applicability to applications such as push-to-talk and to diagnostics like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate how the request was handled is also defined. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5373.txt

5418	A			RFCs from 2009							"Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Threat Analysis for IEEE 802.11 Deployments" was released in March of 2009 by T. Clancy, and S. Kelly. Early Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) deployments feature a "fat" Access Point (AP), which serves as a \%stand-alone interface between the wired and wireless network segments.  However, this model raises scaling, mobility, and manageability issues, and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol is meant to address these issues.  CAPWAP effectively splits the fat AP functionality into two network elements, and the communication channel between these components may traverse potentially hostile hops.  This document analyzes the security exposure resulting from the introduction of CAPWAP and summarizes the associated security considerations for IEEE 802.11-based CAPWAP implementations and deployments.

5419	A			RFCs from 2009							"Why the Authentication Data Suboption is Needed for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)" was released in January of 2009 by B. Patil, and G. Dommety. Mobile IPv6 defines a set of signaling messages that enable the mobile node (MN) to authenticate and perform registration with its home agent (HA).  These authentication signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent are secured by an IPsec security association (SA) that is established between the MN and HA.  The MIP6 working group has specified a mechanism to secure the Binding Update (BU) and Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) messages using an authentication option, similar to the authentication option in Mobile IPv4, carried within the signaling messages that are exchanged between the MN and HA to establish a binding.  This document provides the justifications as to why the authentication option mechanism is needed for Mobile IPv6 deployment in certain environments.

The offer/answer model for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) assumes that endpoints somehow establish the Quality of Service (QoS) required for the media streams they establish.  Endpoints in closed environments typically agree out-of-band (e.g., using configuration information) regarding which QoS mechanism to use.  However, on the Internet, there is more than one QoS service available.  Consequently, there is a need for a mechanism to negotiate which QoS mechanism to use for a particular media stream.

The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.  In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems.  This document specifies a procedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute such inter-domain shortest constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains, using a backward-recursive path computation technique.

5443	A			RFCs from 2009							"LDP IGP Synchronization" was released in March of 2009 by A. Atlas, L. Fang, and M. Jork. In certain networks, there is dependency on the edge-to-edge Label Switched Paths (LSPs) setup by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), e.g., networks that are used for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications.  For such applications, it is not possible to rely on Internet Protocol (IP) forwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately.  Blackholing of labeled traffic can occur in situations where the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link on which LDP is not.  While the link could still be used for IP forwarding, it is not useful for MPLS forwarding, for example, MPLS VPN applications or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route-free cores.  This document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing any protocol changes.

5447	A			RFCs from 2009							"Diameter Mobile IPv6: Support for Network Access Server to Diameter Server Interaction" was released in February of 2009 by H. Tschofenig, C. Perkins, J. Korhonen, K. Chowdhury, and J. Bournelle. A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and a security association with its home agent before it can start utilizing Mobile IPv6.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these parameters be statically configured.  Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping work aims to make this information dynamically available to the mobile node.  An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution is to support interworking with existing Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) infrastructures.  This document describes MIPv6 bootstrapping using the Diameter Network Access Server to home AAA server interface. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5447.txt

5482	A			RFCs from 2009							"TCP User Timeout Option" was released in March of 2009 by L. Eggert, and F. Gont. The TCP user timeout controls how long transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before a connection is forcefully closed.  It is a local, per-connection parameter.  This document specifies a new TCP option -- the TCP User Timeout Option -- that allows one end of a TCP connection to advertise its current user timeout value.  This information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to adapt its user timeout accordingly.  Increasing the user timeouts on both ends of a TCP connection allows it to survive extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.  Decreasing the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their clients that they will maintain the connection state only for a short time without connectivity.

Tschofenig, J. Winterbottom, and M. Thomson. The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) specification provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information.  There are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented.  In these circumstances, the range of options that need to be implemented are reduced.  There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained in a PIDF-LO for routing applications.  To allow successful interoperability between applications, location information needs to be normative and more tightly constrained than is currently specified in RFC 4119 (PIDF-LO).

Rosen. In certain situations, transporting a packet from one Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) speaker to another (the BGP next hop) requires that the packet be encapsulated by the first BGP speaker and decapsulated by the second. To support these situations, there needs to be some agreement between the two BGP speakers with regard to the "encapsulation information", i.e., the format of the encapsulation header as well as the contents of various fields of the header.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5512.txt
5513	A			RFCs from 2009							"IANA Considerations for Three Letter Acronyms" was released in April of 2009 by A. Farrel. Three Letter Acronyms (TLAs) are commonly used to identify components of networks or protocols as designed or specified within the IETF. A common concern is that one acronym may have multiple expansions. While this may not have been an issue in the past, network convergence means that protocols that did not previously operate together are now found in close proximity. This results in contention for acronyms, and confusion in interpretation. Such confusion has the potential to degrade the performance of the Internet as misunderstandings lead to misconfiguration or other operating errors.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5513.txt
5514	A			RFCs from 2009							"IPv6 over Social Networks" was released in April of 2009 by E. Vyncke. There is a lack of IPv6 utilization in early 2009; this is partly linked to the fact that the number of IPv6 nodes is rather low.  This document proposes to vastly increase the number of IPv6 hosts by transforming all Social Networking platforms into IPv6 networks.  This will immediately add millions of IPv6 hosts to the existing IPv6 Internet.  This document includes sections on addressing and transport of IPv6 over a Social Network.  A working prototype has been developed.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5514.txt

5520	A			RFCs from 2009							"Preserving Topology Confidentiality in Inter-Domain Path Computation Using a Path-Key-Based Mechanism" was released in April of 2009 by A. Farrel, JP. Vasseur, and R. Bradford. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous Systems (ASes), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment of the path. However, in some cases (e.g., when ASes are administered by separate Service Providers), it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE to supply a path segment to a PCE in another domain, thus disclosing AS-internal topology information. This issue may be circumvented by returning a loose hop and by invoking a new path computation from the domain boundary Label Switching Router (LSR) during TE LSP setup as the signaling message enters the second domain, but this technique has several issues including the problem of maintaining path diversity.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5520.txt

This document defines the Shim6 protocol, a layer 3 shim for providing locator agility below the transport protocols, so that multihoming can be provided for IPv6 with failover and load-sharing properties, without assuming that a multihomed site will have a provider-independent IPv6 address prefix announced in the global IPv6 routing table.  The hosts in a site that has multiple provider- allocated IPv6 address prefixes will use the Shim6 protocol specified in this document to set up state with peer hosts so that the state can later be used to failover to a different locator pair, should the original one stop working.

5535	A			RFCs from 2009							"Hash-Based Addresses (HBA)" was released in June of 2009 by M. Bagnulo. This memo describes a mechanism to provide a secure binding between the multiple addresses with different prefixes available to a host within a multihomed site.  This mechanism employs either Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) or a new variant of the same theme that uses the same format in the addresses.  The main idea in the new variant is that information about the multiple prefixes is included within the addresses themselves.  This is achieved by generating the interface identifiers of the addresses of a host as hashes of the available prefixes and a random number.  Then, the multiple addresses are generated by prepending the different prefixes to the generated interface identifiers.  The result is a set of addresses, called Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs), that are inherently bound to each other. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5535.txt

5547	A			RFCs from 2009							"A Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Mechanism to Enable File Transfer" was released in May of 2009 by M. Isomaki, P. Kyzivat, S. Loreto, G. Camarillo, and M. Garcia-Martin. This document provides a mechanism to negotiate the transfer of one or more files between two endpoints by using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model specified in RFC 3264.  SDP is extended to describe the attributes of the files to be transferred.  The offerer can describe either the files it wants to send or the files it would like to receive.  The answerer can either accept or reject the offer separately for each individual file.  The transfer of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default mechanism to actually carry the files between the endpoints.  The conventions on how to use MSRP for file transfer are also provided in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5547.txt
5548	A			RFCs from 2009							"Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks" was released in May of 2009 by T. Winter, M. Dohler, T. Watteyne, and D. Barthel. The application-specific routing requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks (U-LLNs) are presented in this document.  In the near future, sensing and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban environments so as to improve people's living conditions as well as to monitor compliance with increasingly strict environmental laws.  These field nodes are expected to measure and report a wide gamut of data (for example, the data required by applications that perform smart-metering or that monitor meteorological, pollution, and allergy conditions).  The majority of these nodes are expected to communicate wirelessly over a variety of links such as IEEE 802.15.4, low-power IEEE 802.11, or IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), which given the limited radio range and the large number of nodes requires the use of suitable routing protocols.  The design of such protocols will be mainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory, processing power, battery, etc.) and the particularities of the outdoor urban application scenarios.  As such, for a wireless solution for Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL) networks to be useful, the protocol(s) ought to be energy-efficient, scalable, and autonomous.  This documents aims to specify a set of IPv6 routing requirements reflecting these and further U-LLNs' tailored characteristics.

5549	A			RFCs from 2009							"Advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information with an IPv6 Next Hop" was released in May of 2009 by F. Le Faucheur, and E. Rosen. Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of network-layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4 NLRI.  This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.

This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions, restrictions, and usage modes), dubbed Lemonade, of the IMAP, mail submission, and Sieve protocols. This profile allows clients (especially those that are constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas) to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail. This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to download and upload the mail, to optimize submission, and to efficiently resynchronize in case of loss of connectivity with the server.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5550.txt

Notification and filtering mechanisms can make email more enjoyable on mobile and other constrained devices (such as those with limited screen sizes, memory, data transfer rates, etc.). Notifications make the client aware of significant events (such as the arrival of new mail) so it can react (such as by fetching interesting mail immediately). Filtering reduces the visible mail to a set of messages that meet some criteria for "interesting". This functionality is included in the goals of the Lemonade (Enhancements to Internet email to Support Diverse Service Environments) Working Group.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5551.txt

5556	A			RFCs from 2009							"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Problem and Applicability Statement" was released in May of 2009 by R. Perlman, and J. Touch. Current IEEE 802.1 LANs use spanning tree protocols that have a number of challenges.  These protocols need to strictly avoid loops, even temporary ones, during route propagation, because of the lack of header loop detection support.  Routing tends not to take full advantage of alternate paths, or even non-overlapping pairwise paths (in the case of spanning trees).  This document addresses these concerns and suggests applying modern network-layer routing protocols at the link layer.  This document assumes that solutions would not address issues of scalability beyond that of existing IEEE 802.1 bridged links, but that a solution would be backward compatible with 802.1, including hubs, bridges, and their existing plug-and-play capabilities.

5557	A			RFCs from 2009							"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Requirements and Protocol Extensions in Support of Global Concurrent Optimization" was released in July of 2009 by E. Oki, JL. Le Roux, D. King, and Y. Lee. The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) allows Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to request path computations from Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and lets the PCEs return responses. When computing or reoptimizing the routes of a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) through a network, it may be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in order to avoid blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-wide solutions. Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO). A GCO is able to simultaneously consider the entire topology of the network and the complete set of existing TE LSPs, and their respective constraints, and look to optimize or reoptimize the entire network to satisfy all constraints for all TE LSPs. A GCO may also be applied to some subset of the TE LSPs in a network. The GCO application is primarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5557.txt

5563	A			RFCs from 2010							"WiMAX Forum / 3GPP2 Proxy Mobile IPv4" was released in February of 2010 by K. Chowdhury, K. Leung, P. Yegani, and G. Dommety. Mobile IPv4 is a standard mobility protocol that enables an IPv4 device to move among networks while maintaining its IP address.  The mobile device has the Mobile IPv4 client function to signal its location to the routing anchor, known as the Home Agent.  However, there are many IPv4 devices without such capability due to various reasons.  This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv4 (PMIPv4), a scheme based on having the Mobile IPv4 client function in a network entity to provide mobility support for an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device.  This document also describes a particular application of PMIPv4 as specified in the WiMAX Forum and another application that is to be adopted in 3GPP2.

5565	A			RFCs from 2009							"Softwire Mesh Framework" was released in June of 2009 by E. Rosen, J. Wu, C. Metz, and Y. Cui. The Internet needs to be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  However, it is expected that some constituent networks of the Internet will be "single-protocol" networks.  One kind of single-protocol network can parse only IPv4 packets and can process only IPv4 routing information; another kind can parse only IPv6 packets and can process only IPv6 routing information.  It is nevertheless required that either kind of single-protocol network be able to provide transit service for the "other" protocol.  This is done by passing the "other kind" of routing information from one edge of the single-protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the "other kind" of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels are known as "softwires".  This framework document explains how the routing information and the data packets of one protocol are passed through a single-protocol network of the other protocol.  The document is careful to specify when this can be done with existing technology and when it requires the development of new or modified technology.

5568	A			RFCs from 2009							"Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers" was released in July of 2009 by R. Koodli. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+5268">RFC 5268</a>. Mobile IPv6 enables a mobile node (MN) to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover. During handover, there is a period during which the mobile node is unable to send or receive packets because of link-switching delay and IP protocol operations. This "handover latency" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures (namely, movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding Update) is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well. This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures. This document does not address improving the link-switching latency.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5568.txt
5569	A			RFCs from 2010							"IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd)" was released in January of 2010 by R. Despres. IPv6 rapid deployment on IPv4 infrastructures (6rd) builds upon mechanisms of 6to4 to enable a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast service to IPv4 sites to which it provides customer premise equipment.  Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in order to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.  Unlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in place of the fixed 6to4 prefix.  A service provider has used this mechanism for its own IPv6 "rapid deployment": five weeks from first exposure to 6rd principles to more than 1,500,000 residential sites being provided native IPv6, under the only condition that they activate it.

A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the establishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or IPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.

This document provides an overview of the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) service and describes how it can fit into a messaging service.  It also describes how DKIM relates to other IETF message signature technologies.  It is intended for those who are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM.  DKIM allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be verified by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures from the same or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public-key cryptography, with the domain name service as its key server technology (RFC 4871).  This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message contents.  DKIM also enables a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.

This document reports the outcome of a workshop organized by the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area Directors of the IETF to discuss network delay and congestion issues resulting from increased Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic volumes.  The workshop was held on May 28, 2008 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA.  The goals of the workshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that ISPs and end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic, and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in addressing these problems.  Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter goal.  The workshop was very well attended and produced several work items that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community.

5595	A			RFCs from 2009							"The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Service Codes" was released in September of 2009 by G. Fairhurst. This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340.  It motivates the setting of a Service Code by applications.  Service Codes provide a method to identify the intended service/application to process a DCCP connection request.  This provides improved flexibility in the use and assignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing.  The use of a DCCP Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination of services with middleboxes (e.g., network address translators and firewalls).  This document updates the specification provided in RFC 4340. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5595.txt

5598	A			RFCs from 2009							"Internet Mail Architecture" was released in July of 2009 by D. Crocker. Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.

5614	A			RFCs from 2009							"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension of OSPF Using Connected Dominating Set (CDS) Flooding" was released in August of 2009 by P. Spagnolo, and R. Ogier. This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.  The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two ways.  First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies.  Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks.  The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension.  The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5614.txt

Kohler, and S. Floyd. This document specifies a profile for Congestion Control Identifier 4, the small-packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP (RFC 4828), a variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small packets.  CCID 4 is considered experimental because TFRC-SP is itself experimental, and is not proposed for widespread deployment in the global Internet at this time.  The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same level of congestion.  CCID 4 is for use for senders that send small packets and would like a TCP- friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.

A network may comprise multiple layers. It is important to globally optimize network resource utilization, taking into account all layers rather than optimizing resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows better network efficiency to be achieved through a process that we call inter-layer traffic engineering. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool to achieve inter-layer traffic engineering.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5623.txt

5626	A			RFCs from 2009							"Managing Client-Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in October of 2009 by R. Mahy, C. Jennings, and F. Audet. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It also defines keep-alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent to its registrar.

5629	A			RFCs from 2009							"A Framework for Application Interaction in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in October of 2009 by J. Rosenberg. This document describes a framework for the interaction between users and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based applications.  By interacting with applications, users can guide the way in which they operate.  The focus of this framework is stimulus signaling, which allows a user agent (UA) to interact with an application without knowledge of the semantics of that application.  Stimulus signaling can occur to a user interface running locally with the client, or to a remote user interface, through media streams.  Stimulus signaling encompasses a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from clicking on hyperlinks, to pressing buttons, to traditional Dual-Tone Multi- Frequency (DTMF) input.  In all cases, stimulus signaling is supported through the use of markup languages, which play a key role in this framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5629.txt

5634	A			RFCs from 2009							"Quick-Start for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)" was released in August of 2009 by G. Fairhurst, and A. Sathiaseelan. This document specifies the use of the Quick-Start mechanism by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DCCP is a transport protocol that allows the transmission of congestion-controlled, unreliable datagrams.  DCCP is intended for applications such as streaming media, Internet telephony, and online games.  In DCCP, an application has a choice of congestion control mechanisms, each specified by a Congestion Control Identifier (CCID).  This document specifies general procedures applicable to all DCCP CCIDs and specific procedures for the use of Quick-Start with DCCP CCID 2, CCID 3, and CCID 4.  Quick-Start enables a DCCP sender to cooperate with Quick-Start routers along the end-to-end path to determine an allowed sending rate at the start of a connection and, at times, in the middle of a DCCP connection (e.g., after an idle or application- limited period).  The present specification is provided for use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

5636	A			RFCs from 2009							"Traceable Anonymous Certificate" was released in August of 2009 by S. Kent, J. Lee, Y. Won, H. Park, and S. Park. This document defines a practical architecture and protocols for offering privacy for a user who requests and uses an X.509 certificate containing a pseudonym, while still retaining the ability to map such a certificate to the real user who requested it.  The architecture is compatible with IETF certificate request formats such as PKCS10 (RFC 2986) and CMC (RFC 5272).  The architecture separates the authorities involved in issuing a certificate: one for verifying ownership of a private key (Blind Issuer) and the other for validating the contents of a certificate (Anonymity Issuer).  The end entity (EE) certificates issued under this model are called Traceable Anonymous Certificates (TACs).  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5636.txt
5637	A			RFCs from 2009							"Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Goals for Mobile IPv6" was released in September of 2009 by R. Lopez, G. Giaretta, E. Demaria, I. Guardini, and J. Bournelle. In commercial and enterprise deployments, Mobile IPv6 can be a service offered by a Mobility Services Provider (MSP).  In this case, all protocol operations may need to be explicitly authorized and traced, requiring the interaction between Mobile IPv6 and the AAA infrastructure.  Integrating the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure (e.g., Network Access Server and AAA server) also offers a solution component for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping.  This document describes various scenarios where a AAA interface for Mobile IPv6 is required.  Additionally, it lists design goals and requirements for such an interface.

5638	A			RFCs from 2009							"Simple SIP Usage Scenario for Applications in the Endpoints" was released in September of 2009 by E. Shim, H. Sinnreich, K. Singh, and A. Johnston. For Internet-centric usage, the number of SIP-required standards for presence and IM and audio/video communications can be drastically smaller than what has been published by using only the rendezvous and session-initiation capabilities of SIP. The simplification is achieved by avoiding the emulation of telephony and its model of the intelligent network. 'Simple SIP' relies on powerful computing endpoints. Simple SIP desktop applications can be combined with rich Internet applications (RIAs). Significant telephony features may also be implemented in the endpoints.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5638.txt

This memo proposes several elliptic curve domain parameters over finite prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  The domain parameters are consistent with the relevant international standards, and can be used in X.509 certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs), for Internet Key Exchange (IKE), Transport Layer Security (TLS), XML signatures, and all applications or protocols based on the cryptographic message syntax (CMS).  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5639.txt
5640	A			RFCs from 2009							"Load-Balancing for Mesh Softwires" was released in August of 2009 by P. Mohapatra, C. Pignataro, and C. Filsfils. Payloads transported over a Softwire mesh service (as defined by BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) information exchange) often carry a number of identifiable, distinct flows.  It can, in some circumstances, be desirable to distribute these flows over the equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist in the packet switched network.  Currently, the payload of a packet entering the Softwire can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers.  Thus, the load-balancing decision of a core router is only based on the encapsulating header, presenting much less entropy than available in the payload or the encapsulated header since the Softwire encapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion.  This document describes a method for achieving comparable load-balancing efficiency in a network carrying Softwire mesh service over Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) over IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what would be achieved without such encapsulation.

According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node may have several care-of addresses but only one, called the primary care-of address, can be registered with its home agent and the correspondent nodes.  However, for matters of cost, bandwidth, delay, etc, it is useful for the mobile node to get Internet access through multiple accesses simultaneously, in which case the mobile node would be configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of addresses.  This document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register and use multiple care-of addresses.  The extensions proposed in this document can be used by mobile routers using the NEMO (Network Mobility) Basic Support protocol as well. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5648.txt

5658	A			RFCs from 2009							"Addressing Record-Route Issues in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" was released in October of 2009 by C. Lebel, B. Bonnaerens, and T. Froment. A typical function of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy is to insert a Record-Route header into initial, dialog-creating requests in order to make subsequent, in-dialog requests pass through it.  This header contains a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or SIPS (secure SIP) URI indicating where and how the subsequent requests should be sent to reach the proxy.  These SIP or SIPS URIs can contain IPv4 or IPv6 addresses and URI parameters that could influence the routing such as the transport parameter (for example, transport=tcp), or a compression indication like "comp=sigcomp".  When a proxy has to change some of those parameters between its incoming and outgoing interfaces (multi-homed proxies, transport protocol switching, or IPv4 to IPv6 scenarios, etc.), the question arises on what should be put in Record-Route header(s).  It is not possible to make one header have the characteristics of both interfaces at the same time.  This document aims to clarify these scenarios and fix bugs already identified on this topic; it formally recommends the use of the double Record-Route technique as an alternative to the current RFC 3261 text, which describes only a Record-Route rewriting solution.

5661	A			RFCs from 2010							"Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol" was released in January of 2010 by D. Noveck, S. Shepler, and M. Eisler. This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 3530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  Major extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1 has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is considered a separate protocol.  Thus, this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC 3530.  NFS minor version 1 is deemed superior to NFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality, and its use is preferred over version 0.

This ability to bypass the server for data access can increase both performance and parallelism, but requires additional client functionality for data access, some of which is dependent on the class of storage used.  The main pNFS operations document specifies storage-class-independent extensions to NFS; this document specifies the additional extensions (primarily data structures) for use of pNFS with block- and volume-based storage.

5684	A			RFCs from 2010							"Unintended Consequences of NAT Deployments with Overlapping Address Space" was released in February of 2010 by P. Srisuresh, and B. Ford. This document identifies two deployment scenarios that have arisen from the unconventional network topologies formed using Network Address Translator (NAT) devices.  First, the simplicity of administering networks through the combination of NAT and DHCP has increasingly lead to the deployment of multi-level inter-connected private networks involving overlapping private IP address spaces.  Second, the proliferation of private networks in enterprises, hotels and conferences, and the wide-spread use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to access an enterprise intranet from remote locations has increasingly lead to overlapping private IP address space between remote and corporate networks.  This document does not dismiss these unconventional scenarios as invalid, but recognizes them as real and offers recommendations to help ensure these deployments can function without a meltdown.

5685	A			RFCs from 2009							"Redirect Mechanism for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)" was released in November of 2009 by V. Devarapalli, and K. Weniger. The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a protocol for setting up Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels from a remote location to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services in the network behind the gateway.  This document defines an IKEv2 extension that allows an overloaded VPN gateway or a VPN gateway that is being shut down for maintenance to redirect the VPN client to attach to another gateway.  The proposed mechanism can also be used in Mobile IPv6 to enable the home agent to redirect the mobile node to another home agent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5685.txt

This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements, and captures design aspects for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 (L7) Location Configuration Protocol (LCP).  This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network.  The obtained location information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and purposes.  For example, it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol or to convey location within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to other entities.

5688	A			RFCs from 2010							"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Media Feature Tag for MIME Application Subtypes" was released in January of 2010 by J. Rosenberg. The caller preferences specification for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows a caller to express preferences that the call be routed to a User Agent (UA) with particular capabilities.  Similarly, a specification exists to allow a UA to indicate its capabilities in a registration.  Amongst those capabilities are the type of media streams the agent supports, described as top-level MIME types.  The 'application' MIME type is used to describe a broad range of stream types, and it provides insufficient granularity as a capability.  This specification allows a UA to indicate which application subtypes the agent supports. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5688.txt

5690	A			RFCs from 2010							"Adding Acknowledgement Congestion Control to TCP" was released in February of 2010 by D. Ros, A. Arcia, J. Iyengar, and S. Floyd. This document describes a possible congestion control mechanism for acknowledgement (ACKs) traffic in TCP.  The document specifies an end-to-end acknowledgement congestion control mechanism for TCP that uses participation from both TCP hosts: the TCP data sender and the TCP data receiver.  The TCP data sender detects lost or Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-marked ACK packets, and tells the TCP data receiver the ACK Ratio R to use to respond to the congestion on the reverse path from the data receiver to the data sender.  The TCP data receiver sends roughly one ACK packet for every R data packets received.  This mechanism is based on the acknowledgement congestion control in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol's (DCCP's) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) 2.  This acknowledgement congestion control mechanism is being specified for further evaluation by the network community.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5690.txt

5692	A			RFCs from 2009							"Transmission of IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 Networks" was released in October of 2009 by S. Jeong, M. Riegel, and H. Jeon. This document describes the transmission of IPv4 over Ethernet, as well as IPv6 over Ethernet, in an access network deploying the IEEE 802.16 cellular radio transmission technology.  The Ethernet on top of IEEE 802.16 is realized by bridging connections that IEEE 802.16 provides between a base station and its associated subscriber stations.  Due to the resource constraints of radio transmission systems and the limitations of the IEEE 802.16 Media Access Control (MAC) functionality for the realization of an Ethernet, the transmission of IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 may considerably benefit by adding IP-specific support functions in the Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 while maintaining full compatibility with standard IP over Ethernet behavior.

5693	A			RFCs from 2009							"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement" was released in October of 2009 by E. Burger, and J. Seedorf. Distributed applications -- such as file sharing, real-time communication, and live and on-demand media streaming -- prevalent on the Internet use a significant amount of network resources. Such applications often transfer large amounts of data through connections established between nodes distributed across the Internet with little knowledge of the underlying network topology. Some applications are so designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which to exchange data. Absent any topology information guiding such choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information obtained from measurements and statistics, these applications often make less than desirable choices.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5693.txt

5696	A			RFCs from 2009							"Baseline Encoding and Transport of Pre-Congestion Information" was released in November of 2009 by T. Moncaster, M. Menth, and B. Briscoe. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+6660">RFC 6660</a>. The objective of the Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) architecture is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.  It achieves this by marking packets belonging to PCN-flows when the rate of traffic exceeds certain configured thresholds on links in the domain.  These marks can then be evaluated to determine how close the domain is to being congested.  This document specifies how such marks are encoded into the IP header by redefining the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within such domains.  The baseline encoding described here provides only two PCN encoding states: Not-marked and PCN-marked.  Future extensions to this encoding may be needed in order to provide more than one level of marking severity. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5696.txt

Current specifications of BGP Extended Communities (RFC 4360) support the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, but do not support an IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community.  The lack of an IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community may be a problem when an application uses the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, and one wants to use this application in a pure IPv6 environment.  This document defines a new BGP attribute, the IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community, that addresses this problem.  The IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community is similar to the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, except that it carries an IPv6 address rather than an IPv4 address.

5707	A			RFCs from 2010							"Media Server Markup Language (MSML)" was released in February of 2010 by A. Saleem, G. Sharratt, and Y. Xin. The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and invoke many different types of services on IP media servers.  The MSML control interface was initially driven by RadiSys with subsequent significant contributions from Intel, Dialogic, and others in the industry.  Clients can use it to define how multimedia sessions interact on a media server and to apply services to individuals or groups of users.  MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams.  As well, clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences.  Transformation of media streams to and from users or conferences as well as interactive voice response (IVR) dialogs are examples of such interactions, which are specified using MSML.  MSML clients may also invoke dialogs with individual users or with groups of conference participants using VoiceXMLThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5707.txt

This document describes how Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) PathErr messages may be used to trigger rerouting of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) point-to-point Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) without first removing LSP state or resources.  Such LSP rerouting may be desirable in a number of cases, including, for example, soft-preemption and graceful shutdown.  This document describes the usage of existing Standards Track mechanisms to support LSP rerouting.  In this case, it relies on mechanisms already defined as part of RSVP-TE and simply describes a sequence of actions to be executed.  While existing protocol definitions can be used to support reroute applications, this document also defines a new reroute-specific error code to allow for the future definition of reroute-application-specific error values.

5712	A			RFCs from 2010							"MPLS Traffic Engineering Soft Preemption" was released in January of 2010 by JP. Vasseur, and M. Meyer. This document specifies Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications extending the concept of preemption with the goal of reducing or eliminating traffic disruption of preempted Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE was defined with support for only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption.  The utilization of a reroute request notification helps more gracefully mitigate the reroute process of preempted TE LSP.  For the brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned until the TE LSP(s) can be rerouted.  For this reason, the feature is primarily, but not exclusively, interesting in MPLS-enabled IP networks with Differentiated Services and Traffic Engineering capabilities.

The Diameter base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides a number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands (i.e., messages used by Diameter applications) and applications as the most extensive enhancements. RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions that lead to the need to define a new Diameter application or a new command code. Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension, IETF actions are necessary. Although defining new Diameter applications does not require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands requires IETF consensus per RFC 3588. This has led to questionable design decisions by other Standards Development Organizations, which chose to define new applications on existing commands -- rather than asking for assignment of new command codes -- for the pure purpose of avoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF. In some cases, interoperability problems were an effect of the poor design caused by overloading existing commands.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5719.txt

RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term "enterprise network" within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an "enterprise" can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.

5725	A			RFCs from 2010							"Post-Repair Loss RLE Report Block Type for RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs)" was released in February of 2010 by A. Begen, M. Lague, and D. Hsu. This document defines a new report block type within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs).  One of the initial XR report block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE) Report Block.  This report conveys information regarding the individual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet receipt and loss events experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the transmission of the report.  The new report, which is referred to as the Post-repair Loss RLE report, carries information regarding the packets that remain lost after all loss-repair methods are applied.  By comparing the RTP packet receipts/losses before and after the loss repair is completed, one can determine the effectiveness of the loss- repair methods in an aggregated fashion.  This document also defines the signaling of the Post-repair Loss RLE report in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5725.txt

It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+3940">RFC 3940</a>. This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative- ACKnowledgment (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol.  This protocol can provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal a priori coordination among senders and receivers.  A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher-level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways.  The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based (forward error correction) repair and other IETF Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.  This document obsoletes RFC 3940.

5746	A			RFCs from 2010							"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Renegotiation Indication Extension" was released in February of 2010 by S. Dispensa, M. Ray, E. Rescorla, and N. Oskov. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation are vulnerable to an attack in which the attacker forms a TLS connection with the target server, injects content of his choice, and then splices in a new TLS connection from a client.  The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data.  This specification defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tie renegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over, thus preventing this attack.

5749	A			RFCs from 2010							"Distribution of EAP-Based Keys for Handover and Re-Authentication" was released in March of 2010 by M. Nakhjiri, Y. Ohba, and K. Hoeper. This document describes an abstract mechanism for delivering root keys from an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) server to another network server that requires the keys for offering security protected services, such as re-authentication, to an EAP peer.  The distributed root key can be either a usage-specific root key (USRK), a domain-specific root key (DSRK), or a domain-specific usage- specific root key (DSUSRK) that has been derived from an Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) hierarchy previously established between the EAP server and an EAP peer.  This document defines a template for a key distribution exchange (KDE) protocol that can distribute these different types of root keys using a AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) protocol and discusses its security requirements.  The described protocol template does not specify message formats, data encoding, or other implementation details.  It thus needs to be instantiated with a specific protocol (e.g., RADIUS or Diameter) before it can be used. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5749.txt

5765	A			RFCs from 2010							"Security Issues and Solutions in Peer-to-Peer Systems for Realtime Communications" was released in February of 2010 by E. Ivov, H. Schulzrinne, and E. Marocco. Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become popular for certain applications and deployments for a variety of reasons, including fault tolerance, economics, and legal issues.  It has therefore become reasonable for resource consuming and typically centralized applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime communication to adapt and exploit the benefits of P2P.  Such a migration needs to address a new set of P2P-specific security problems.  This document describes some of the known issues found in common P2P networks, analyzing the relevance of such issues and the applicability of existing solutions when using P2P architectures for realtime communication.  This document is a product of the P2P Research Group.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5765.txt
5766	A			RFCs from 2010							"Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)" was released in April of 2010 by R. Mahy, J. Rosenberg, and P. Matthews. If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers).  In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay.  This specification defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay.  TURN differs from some other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address.

This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it is based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and in "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6".  VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master, and it forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Master routers are configured with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup routers infer the address family of the virtual addresses being carried based on the transport protocol.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are a domain unto themselves and do not overlap.  The election process provides dynamic failover in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switchover to Backup routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.

5814	A			RFCs from 2010							"Label Switched Path (LSP) Dynamic Provisioning Performance Metrics in Generalized MPLS Networks" was released in March of 2010 by W. Sun, and G. Zhang. Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is one of the most promising candidate technologies for a future data transmission network. GMPLS has been developed to control and operate different kinds of network elements, such as conventional routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs), optical cross- connects (OXCs), etc. These physically diverse devices differ drastically from one another in dynamic provisioning ability. At the same time, the need for dynamically provisioned connections is increasing because optical networks are being deployed in metro areas. As different applications have varied requirements in the provisioning performance of optical networks, it is imperative to define standardized metrics and procedures such that the performance of networks and application needs can be mapped to each other.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5814.txt

5839	A			RFCs from 2010							"An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events for Conditional Event Notification" was released in May of 2010 by D. Willis, and A. Niemi. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents.  This framework defines the procedures for creating, refreshing, and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and periodic polling of resource state.  These procedures provide no tools to avoid replaying event notifications that have already been received by a user agent.  This memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed since the previous notification was received.  When such a condition is true, either the body of a resulting event notification or the entire notification message is suppressed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5839.txt
5840	A			RFCs from 2010							"Wrapped Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) for Traffic Visibility" was released in April of 2010 by M. Bhatia, K. Grewal, and G. Montenegro. This document describes the Wrapped Encapsulating Security Payload (WESP) protocol, which builds on the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) RFC 4303 and is designed to allow intermediate devices to (1) ascertain if data confidentiality is being employed within ESP, and if not, (2) inspect the IPsec packets for network monitoring and access control functions.  Currently, in the IPsec ESP standard, there is no deterministic way to differentiate between encrypted and unencrypted payloads by simply examining a packet.  This poses certain challenges to the intermediate devices that need to deep inspect the packet before making a decision on what should be done with that packet (Inspect and/or Allow/Drop).  The mechanism described in this document can be used to easily disambiguate integrity-only ESP from ESP-encrypted packets, without compromising on the security provided by ESP.

5863	A			RFCs from 2010							"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Development, Deployment, and Operations" was released in May of 2010 by P. Hallam-Baker, E. Siegel, T. Hansen, and D. Crocker. DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows an organization to claim responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public key cryptography and using the domain name service as its key server technology.  This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message content.  DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  DKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing".  This document provides implementation, deployment, operational, and migration considerations for DKIM.

One desirable application of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is to detect a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) data plane failure.  LSP Ping is an existing mechanism for detecting MPLS data plane failures and for verifying the MPLS LSP data plane against the control plane.  BFD can be used for the former, but not for the latter.  However, the control plane processing required for BFD Control packets is relatively smaller than the processing required for LSP Ping messages.  A combination of LSP Ping and BFD can be used to provide faster data plane failure detection and/or make it possible to provide such detection on a greater number of LSPs.  This document describes the applicability of BFD in relation to LSP Ping for this application.  It also describes procedures for using BFD in this environment.

5894	A			RFCs from 2010							"Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Background, Explanation, and Rationale" was released in August of 2010 by J. Klensin. Several years have passed since the original protocol for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) was completed and deployed.  During that time, a number of issues have arisen, including the need to update the system to deal with newer versions of Unicode.  Some of these issues require tuning of the existing protocols and the tables on which they depend.  This document provides an overview of a revised system and provides explanatory material for its components.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5894.txt
5895	A			RFCs from 2010							"Mapping Characters for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) 2008" was released in September of 2010 by P. Hoffman, and P. Resnick. In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user input were mapped into a set of Unicode code points that "made sense", and then encoded and passed to the domain name system (DNS).  The IDNA2008 protocol (described in RFCs 5890, 5891, 5892, and 5893) presumes that the input to the protocol comes from a set of "permitted" code points, which it then encodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do with the result of user input.  This document describes the actions that can be taken by an implementation between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to the new IDNA protocol.

5896	A			RFCs from 2010							"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API): Delegate if Approved by Policy" was released in June of 2010 by L. Hornquist Astrand, and S. Hartman. Several Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) applications work in a multi-tiered architecture, where the server takes advantage of delegated user credentials to act on behalf of the user and contact additional servers.  In effect, the server acts as an agent on behalf of the user.  Examples include web applications that need to access e-mail or file servers, including CIFS (Common Internet File System) file servers.  However, delegating the user credentials to a party who is not sufficiently trusted is problematic from a security standpoint.  Kerberos provides a flag called OK-AS-DELEGATE that allows the administrator of a Kerberos realm to communicate that a particular service is trusted for delegation.  This specification adds support for this flag and similar facilities in other authentication mechanisms to GSS-API (RFC 2743). [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5896.txt

This document considers the problem of service identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  Service identification is the process of determining the user-level use case that is driving the signaling being utilized by the user agent (UA).  This document discusses the uses of service identification, and outlines several architectural principles behind the process.  It identifies perils when service identification is not done properly -- including fraud, interoperability failures, and stifling of innovation.  It then outlines a set of recommended practices for service identification.

5898	A			RFCs from 2010							"Connectivity Preconditions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) Media Streams" was released in July of 2010 by F. Andreasen, D. Oran, D. Wing, and G. Camarillo. This document defines a new connectivity precondition for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) precondition framework.  A connectivity precondition can be used to delay session establishment or modification until media stream connectivity has been successfully verified.  The method of verification may vary depending on the type of transport used for the media.  For unreliable datagram transports such as UDP, verification involves probing the stream with data or control packets.  For reliable connection-oriented transports such as TCP, verification can be achieved simply by successful connection establishment or by probing the connection with data or control packets, depending on the situation.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize computer clocks in the Internet.  This document describes NTP version 4 (NTPv4), which is backwards compatible with NTP version 3 (NTPv3), described in RFC 1305, as well as previous versions of the protocol.  NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5905.txt

This memo describes the Autokey security model for authenticating servers to clients using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and public key cryptography. Its design is based on the premise that IPsec schemes cannot be adopted intact, since that would preclude stateless servers and severely compromise timekeeping accuracy. In addition, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) schemes presume authenticated time values are always available to enforce certificate lifetimes; however, cryptographically verified timestamps require interaction between the timekeeping and authentication functions.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5906.txt

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and sizes for time synchronization of servers, workstations, and other networked equipment.  As time synchronization is more and more a mission-critical service, standardized means for monitoring and management of this subsystem of a networked host are required to allow operators of such a service to set up a monitoring system that is platform- and vendor-independent.  This document provides a standardized collection of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity of such a network participant and it is part of the NTP version 4 standardization effort.

This document enables a pair of communicating proxies to reuse a congestion-controlled connection between themselves for sending requests in the forwards and backwards direction.  Because the connection is essentially aliased for requests going in the backwards direction, reuse is predicated upon both the communicating endpoints authenticating themselves using X.509 certificates through Transport Layer Security (TLS).  For this reason, we only consider connection reuse for TLS over TCP and TLS over Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This document also provides guidelines on connection reuse and virtual SIP servers and the interaction of connection reuse and DNS SRV lookups in SIP.

5925	A			RFCs from 2010							"The TCP Authentication Option" was released in June of 2010 by A. Mankin, R. Bonica, and J. Touch. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+2385">RFC 2385</a>. This document specifies the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), which obsoletes the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC 2385 (TCP MD5).  TCP-AO specifies the use of stronger Message Authentication Codes (MACs), protects against replays even for long-lived TCP connections, and provides more details on the association of security with TCP connections than TCP MD5.  TCP-AO is compatible with either a static Master Key Tuple (MKT) configuration or an external, out-of-band MKT management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects connections when using the same MKT across repeated instances of a connection, using traffic keys derived from the MKT, and coordinates MKT changes between endpoints.  The result is intended to support current infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect long-lived connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other system and operational changes.  TCP-AO uses a different option identifier than TCP MD5, even though TCP-AO and TCP MD5 are never permitted to be used simultaneously.  TCP-AO supports IPv6, and is fully compatible with the proposed requirements for the replacement of TCP MD5. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5925.txt

5939	A			RFCs from 2010							"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Capability Negotiation" was released in September of 2010 by F. Andreasen. The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended to describe multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was not intended to provide capability indication or capability negotiation; however, over the years, SDP has seen widespread adoption and as a result it has been gradually extended to provide limited support for these, notably in the form of the offer/answer model defined in RFC 3264. SDP does not define how to negotiate one or more alternative transport protocols (e.g., RTP profiles) or attributes. This makes it difficult to deploy new RTP profiles such as Secure RTP or RTP with RTCP-based feedback, negotiate use of different security keying mechanisms, etc. It also presents problems for some forms of media negotiation.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5939.txt

This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5944.txt
5945	A			RFCs from 2010							"Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Proxy Approaches" was released in October of 2010 by F. Le Faucheur, J. Manner, A. Guillou, and D. Wing. The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) can be used to make end-to- end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the quality of service required by certain flows.  RSVP assumes that both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  This document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to initiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations to be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end path.  This document reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP proxies and discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating in RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP proxy approach.  However, such extensions are outside the scope of this document.  Finally, practical use cases for RSVP proxy are described.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5945.txt
5946	A			RFCs from 2010							"Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Extensions for Path-Triggered RSVP Receiver Proxy" was released in October of 2010 by H. Malik, A. Narayanan, F. Le Faucheur, J. Manner, and A. Guillou. Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling can be used to make end-to-end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) required by certain flows.  With conventional RSVP, both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are many use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  Where the receiver is not RSVP- capable, an RSVP router may behave as an RSVP Receiver Proxy, thereby performing RSVP signaling on behalf of the receiver.  This allows resource reservations to be established on the segment of the end-to- end path from the sender to the RSVP Receiver Proxy.  However, as discussed in the companion document "RSVP Proxy Approaches", RSVP extensions are needed to facilitate operations with an RSVP Receiver Proxy whose signaling is triggered by receipt of RSVP Path messages from the sender.  This document specifies these extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5946.txt

Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6; RFC 3775) provides a mobile node with IP mobility when it performs a handover from one access router to another, and fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) are specified to enhance the handover performance in terms of latency and packet loss. While MIPv6 (and FMIPv6 as well) requires the participation of the mobile node in the mobility-related signaling, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6; RFC 5213) provides IP mobility to nodes that either have or do not have MIPv6 functionality without such involvement. Nevertheless, the basic performance of PMIPv6 in terms of handover latency and packet loss is considered no different from that of MIPv6.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5949.txt

As IPv6 deployment increases, there will be a dramatic increase in the need to use IPv6 addresses in text.  While the IPv6 address architecture in Section 2.2 of RFC 4291 describes a flexible model for text representation of an IPv6 address, this flexibility has been causing problems for operators, system engineers, and users.  This document defines a canonical textual representation format.  It does not define a format for internal storage, such as within an application or database.  It is expected that the canonical format will be followed by humans and systems when representing IPv6 addresses as text, but all implementations must accept and be able to handle any legitimate RFC 4291 format.

This specification describes the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for signaling Quality of Service (QoS) reservations in the Internet.  It is in accordance with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it provides functionality similar to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and provides examples.

The Quality-of-Service (QoS) NSIS signaling layer protocol (NSLP) is used to signal QoS reservations and is independent of a specific QoS model (QOSM) such as IntServ or Diffserv.  Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is encapsulated in a separate object, the QSPEC.  This document defines a template for the QSPEC including a number of QSPEC parameters.  The QSPEC parameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of QoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled to specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved along the signaling path.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5975.txt

Kappler, and L. Westberg. This document describes a Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Quality-of-Service (QoS) Model for networks that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) concept.  RMD is a technique for adding admission control and preemption function to Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks.  The RMD QoS Model allows devices external to the RMD network to signal reservation requests to Edge nodes in the RMD network.  The RMD Ingress Edge nodes classify the incoming flows into traffic classes and signals resource requests for the corresponding traffic class along the data path to the Egress Edge nodes for each flow.  Egress nodes reconstitute the original requests and continue forwarding them along the data path towards the final destination.  In addition, RMD defines notification functions to indicate overload situations within the domain to the Edge nodes.

5979	A			RFCs from 2011							"NSIS Operation over IP Tunnels" was released in March of 2011 by C. Shen, H. Schulzrinne, J. Bang, and S. Lee. NSIS Quality of Service (QoS) signaling enables applications to perform QoS reservation along a data flow path.  When the data flow path contains IP tunnel segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect within those tunnel segments.  Therefore, the resulting tunnel segments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS efforts in the rest of the end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS signaling within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original IP header fields.  Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS signaling messages and classify QoS data packets.  This document defines a solution to this problem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to corresponding QoS sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS signaling into the IP tunnel segments.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5979.txt

Mobility of an IP-based node affects routing paths, and as a result, can have a significant effect on the protocol operation and state management.  This document discusses the effects mobility can cause to the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) protocol suite, and shows how the NSIS protocols operate in different scenarios with mobility management protocols.

5981	A			RFCs from 2011							"Authorization for NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols" was released in February of 2011 by H. Tschofenig, R. Bless, M. Stiemerling, and J. Manner. Signaling layer protocols specified within the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) framework may rely on the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol to handle authorization.  Still, the signaling layer protocol above GIST itself may require separate authorization to be performed when a node receives a request for a certain kind of service or resources.  This document presents a generic model and object formats for session authorization within the NSIS signaling layer protocols.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to coordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5981.txt

Verhaeghe, Z. Ali, T. Takeda, D. King, Q. Zhao, and J. Meuric. Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may be established using signaling techniques, but their paths may first need to be determined. The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6006.txt
6007	A			RFCs from 2010							"Use of the Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) List for Synchronized Dependent Path Computations" was released in September of 2010 by D. King, and I. Nishioka. A Path Computation Element (PCE) may be required to perform dependent path computations. Dependent path computations are requests that need to be synchronized in order to meet specific objectives. An example of a dependent request would be a PCE computing a set of services that are required to be diverse (disjointed) from each other. When a PCE computes sets of dependent path computation requests concurrently, use of the Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) list is required for association among the sets of dependent path computation requests. The SVEC object is optional and carried within the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) PCRequest (PCReq) message.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6007.txt

6010	A			RFCs from 2010							"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints Extension" was released in September of 2010 by C. Wallace, S. Ashmore, and R. Housley. This document specifies the syntax and semantics for the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) content constraints extension.  This extension is used to determine whether a public key is appropriate to use in the processing of a protected content.  In particular, the CMS content constraints extension is one part of the authorization decision; it is used when validating a digital signature on a CMS SignedData content or validating a message authentication code (MAC) on a CMS AuthenticatedData content or CMS AuthEnvelopedData content.  The signed or authenticated content type is identified by an ASN.1 object identifier, and this extension indicates the content types that the public key is authorized to validate.  If the authorization check is successful, the CMS content constraints extension also provides default values for absent attributes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6010.txt

6015	A			RFCs from 2010							"RTP Payload Format for 1-D Interleaved Parity Forward Error Correction (FEC)" was released in October of 2010 by A. Begen. This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media encapsulated in RTP.  The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.  The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet losses at a cost of reasonable complexity.  The new payload format defined in this document should only be used (with some exceptions) as a part of the Digital Video Broadcasting-IPTV (DVB- IPTV) Application-layer FEC specification.

6024	A			RFCs from 2010							"Trust Anchor Management Requirements" was released in October of 2010 by C. Wallace, and R. Reddy. A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public key and associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital signatures, and the associated data is used to constrain the types of information for which the trust anchor is authoritative.  A relying party uses trust anchors to determine if a digitally signed object is valid by verifying a digital signature using the trust anchor's public key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the associated data for the trust anchor.  This document describes some of the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchor management mechanism and defines requirements for data formats and push-based protocols designed to address these problems.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6024.txt
6025	A			RFCs from 2010							"ASN.1 Translation" was released in October of 2010 by C. Wallace, and C. Gardiner. Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is widely used throughout the IETF Security Area and has been for many years.  Some specifications were written using a now deprecated version of ASN.1 and some were written using the current version of ASN.1.  Not all ASN.1 compilers support both older and current syntax.  This document is intended to provide guidance to specification authors and to implementers converting ASN.1 modules from one version of ASN.1 to another version without causing changes to the "bits on the wire".  This document does not provide a comprehensive tutorial of any version of ASN.1.  Instead, it addresses ASN.1 features that are used in IETF Security Area specifications with a focus on items that vary with the ASN.1 version.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6025.txt
6026	A			RFCs from 2010							"Correct Transaction Handling for 2xx Responses to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INVITE Requests" was released in September of 2010 by T. Zourzouvillys, and R. Sparks. This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to address an error in the specified handling of success (2xx class) responses to INVITE requests.  Elements following RFC 3261 exactly will misidentify retransmissions of the request as a new, unassociated request.  The correction involves modifying the INVITE transaction state machines.  The correction also changes the way responses that cannot be matched to an existing transaction are handled to address a security risk. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6026.txt
6027	A			RFCs from 2010							"IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" was released in October of 2010 by Y. Nir. This document defines the terminology, problem statement, and requirements for implementing Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and IPsec on clusters.  It also describes gaps in existing standards and their implementation that need to be filled in order to allow peers to interoperate with clusters from different vendors.  Agreed upon terminology, problem statement, and requirements will allow IETF working groups to consider development of IPsec/IKEv2 mechanisms to simplify cluster implementations.

6028	A			RFCs from 2010							"Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Multi-Hop Routing Extension" was released in October of 2010 by A. Keranen, and G. Camarillo. This document specifies two extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) to implement multi-hop routing.  The first extension allows implementing source routing in HIP.  That is, a node sending a HIP packet can define a set of nodes that the HIP packet should traverse.  The second extension allows a HIP packet to carry and record the list of nodes that forwarded it.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6028.txt
6029	A			RFCs from 2010							"A Survey on Research on the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem" was released in October of 2010 by M. Tomsu, I. Rimac, V. Hilt, E. Marocco, and V. Gurbani. A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used originally for file sharing, and more recently for real-time communications and live media streaming.  Such applications discover a route to each other through an overlay network with little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As a result, they may choose peers based on information deduced from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal choices.  This document, a product of the P2P Research Group, presents a survey of existing literature on discovering and using network topology information for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6029.txt
6030	A			RFCs from 2010							"Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC)" was released in October of 2010 by S. Machani, M. Pei, and P. Hoyer. This document specifies a symmetric key format for the transport and provisioning of symmetric keys to different types of crypto modules.

6032	A			RFCs from 2010							"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Encrypted Key Package Content Type" was released in December of 2010 by S. Turner, and R. Housley. This document defines the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) encrypted key package content type, which can be used to encrypt a content that includes a key package, such as a symmetric key package or an asymmetric key package.  It is transport independent.  CMS can be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or further encrypt this content type.  It is designed to be used with the CMS Content Constraints (CCC) extension, which does not constrain the EncryptedData, EnvelopedData, and AuthEnvelopedData.

6035	A			RFCs from 2010							"Session Initiation Protocol Event Package for Voice Quality Reporting" was released in November of 2010 by H. Sinnreich, A. Pendleton, A. Johnston, and A. Clark. This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.  Voice call quality information derived from RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP-XR) and call information from SIP is conveyed from a User Agent (UA) in a session, known as a reporter, to a third party, known as a collector.  A registration for the application/ vq-rtcpxr media type is also included. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6035.txt
6036	A			RFCs from 2010							"Emerging Service Provider Scenarios for IPv6 Deployment" was released in October of 2010 by B. Carpenter, and S. Jiang.

6037	A			RFCs from 2010							"Cisco Systems' Solution for Multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs" was released in October of 2010 by IJ. Wijnands, E. Rosen, and Y. Cai. This document describes the MVPN (Multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs) solution designed and deployed by Cisco Systems.  The procedures specified in this document are largely a subset of the generalized MVPN framework recently standardized by the IETF.  However, as the deployment of the procedures specified herein predates the publication of IETF standards (in some cases by over five years), an implementation based on these procedures differs in some respects from a fully standards-compliant implementation.  These differences are pointed out in the document.  This document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6037.txt
6038	A			RFCs from 2010							"Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Reflect Octets and Symmetrical Size Features" was released in October of 2010 by A. Morton, and L. Ciavattone. This memo describes two closely related features for the core specification of the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP): an optional capability where the responding host returns some of the command octets or padding octets to the sender, and an optional sender packet format that ensures equal test packet sizes are used in both directions.

6040	A			RFCs from 2010							"Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" was released in November of 2010 by B. Briscoe. This document redefines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of the IP header should be constructed on entry to and exit from any IP-in-IP tunnel.  On encapsulation, it updates RFC 3168 to bring all IP-in-IP tunnels (v4 or v6) into line with RFC 4301 IPsec ECN processing.  On decapsulation, it updates both RFC 3168 and RFC 4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers.  The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported.  Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility.  Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels (e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification.  A thorough analysis of the reasoning for these changes and the implications is included.  In the unlikely event that the new rules do not meet a specific need, RFC 4774 gives guidance on designing alternate ECN semantics, and this document extends that to include tunnelling issues.

This document specifies the use of the KeyNote trust-management system as an authorization extension in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol, according to guidelines in RFC 5878.  Extensions carried in the client and server hello messages confirm that both parties support the desired authorization data types.  Then, if supported by both the client and the server, KeyNote credentials are exchanged in the supplemental data handshake message.

6043	A			RFCs from 2011							"MIKEY-TICKET: Ticket-Based Modes of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)" was released in March of 2011 by T. Tian, and J. Mattsson. The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification describes a key management scheme for real-time applications.  In this document, we note that the currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to address deployment scenarios built around a centralized key management service.  Interest in such deployments is increasing.  Therefore, a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios are defined.  The new modes use a trusted key management service and a ticket concept, similar to that in Kerberos.  The new modes also support features used by many existing applications, where the exact identity of the other endpoint may not be known at the start of the communication session.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6043.txt

6045	A			RFCs from 2010							"Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID)" was released in November of 2010 by K. Moriarty. It is obsoleted by <a href="/?q=RFC+6545">RFC 6545</a>. Network security incidents, such as system compromises, worms, viruses, phishing incidents, and denial of service, typically result in the loss of service, data, and resources both human and system. Network providers and Computer Security Incident Response Teams need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating and tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack. Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network communication method to facilitate sharing incident handling data while integrating existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms for a complete incident handling solution. Combining these capabilities in a communication system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks. Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the security recommendations and considerations.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6045.txt

6056	A			RFCs from 2011							"Recommendations for Transport-Protocol Port Randomization" was released in January of 2011 by F. Gont, and M. Larsen. During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number of "blind" attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from throughput reduction to broken connections or data corruption.  These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.  This document describes a number of simple and efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol instance, the aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security with very little effort and without any key management overhead.  The algorithms described in this document are local policies that may be incrementally deployed and that do not violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that may benefit from them, such as TCP, UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided that the RTP application explicitly signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers).

Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity, which last longer than one retransmission timeout, cause suboptimal TCP performance. The reason for this performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment loss induced by long connectivity disruptions as a sign of congestion, resulting in repeated retransmission timer backoffs. This, in turn, leads to a delayed detection of the re-establishment of the connection since TCP waits for the next retransmission timeout before it attempts a retransmission.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6069.txt

Provider Provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) may have different "provisioning models", i.e., models for what information needs to be configured in what entities.  Once configured, the provisioning information is distributed by a "discovery process".  When the discovery process is complete, a signaling protocol is automatically invoked to set up the mesh of pseudowires (PWs) that form the (virtual) backbone of the L2VPN.  This document specifies a number of L2VPN provisioning models, and further specifies the semantic structure of the endpoint identifiers required by each model.  It discusses the distribution of these identifiers by the discovery process, especially when discovery is based on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  It then specifies how the endpoint identifiers are carried in the two signaling protocols that are used to set up PWs, the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), and the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3).

6104	A			RFCs from 2011							"Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem Statement" was released in February of 2011 by S. Venaas, and T. Chown. When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are configured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey information to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the network.  This information includes the implied default router address taken from the observed source address of the RA message, as well as on-link prefix information.  However, unintended misconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly malicious attacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in turn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In this document, we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be observed and present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  We focus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text.  The goal of this text is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework around which solutions can be proposed and discussed.

6128	A			RFCs from 2011							"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Port for Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) Sessions" was released in February of 2011 by A. Begen. The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows RTP applications to specify an address and a port associated with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic.  In RTP-based source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used to designate the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity, and thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of the media description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line imposes an unnecessary restriction.  This document removes this restriction by introducing a new SDP attribute.

RFC 5443 describes a mechanism to achieve LDP IGP synchronization to prevent black-holing traffic (e.g., VPN) when an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link but Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is not.  If this mechanism is applied to broadcast links that have more than one LDP peer, the metric increase procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not to an individual peer.  When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network, this can result in loss of traffic through other established peers on that network.

This document defines a mechanism by which a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server acting as a traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) can register with a SIP Service Provider (SSP) to receive phone calls for SIP User Agents (UAs).  In order to function properly, this mechanism requires that each of the Addresses of Record (AORs) registered in bulk map to a unique set of contacts.  This requirement is satisfied by AORs representing phone numbers regardless of the domain, since phone numbers are fully qualified and globally unique.

Bagnulo, I. van Beijnum, and P. Matthews. DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records.  DNS64 is used with an IPv6/IPv4 translator to enable client-server communication between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server, without requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node, for the class of applications that work through NATs.  This document specifies DNS64, and provides suggestions on how it should be deployed in conjunction with IPv6/IPv4 translators. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6147.txt
6148	A			RFCs from 2011							"DHCPv4 Lease Query by Relay Agent Remote ID" was released in February of 2011 by P. Kurapati, R. Desetti, and B. Joshi. Some relay agents extract lease information from the DHCP messages exchanged between the client and DHCP server.  This lease information is used by relay agents for various purposes like antispoofing and prevention of flooding.  RFC 4388 defines a mechanism for relay agents to retrieve the lease information from the DHCP server when this information is lost.  The existing lease query mechanism is data-driven, which means that a relay agent can initiate the lease query only when it starts receiving data to and from the clients.  In certain scenarios, this model is not scalable.  This document first looks at issues in the existing mechanism and then proposes a new query type, query by Remote ID, to address these issues.

Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients allow users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put, but configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new optional mailbox attributes that a server may include in IMAP LIST command responses to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing configuration.

RFC 3177 argued that in IPv6, end sites should be assigned /48 blocks in most cases. The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) adopted that recommendation in 2002, but began reconsidering the policy in 2005. This document obsoletes the RFC 3177 recommendations on the assignment of IPv6 address space to end sites. The exact choice of how much address space to assign end sites is an issue for the operational community. The IETF's role in this case is limited to providing guidance on IPv6 architectural and operational considerations. This document reviews the architectural and operational considerations of end site assignments as well as the motivations behind the original recommendations in RFC 3177. Moreover, this document clarifies that a one-size-fits-all recommendation of /48 is not nuanced enough for the broad range of end sites and is no longer recommended as a single default.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6177.txt
6178	A			RFCs from 2011							"Label Edge Router Forwarding of IPv4 Option Packets" was released in March of 2011 by D. Smith, T. Scholl, W. Jaeger, and J. Mullooly. This document specifies how Label Edge Routers (LERs) should behave when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IPv4 packet with header options.  Lack of a formal standard has resulted in different LER forwarding behaviors for IPv4 packets with header options despite being associated with a prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC).  IPv4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based FEC, yet are forwarded into an IPv4/MPLS network without being MPLS- encapsulated, present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.  Further, LERs that are unable to MPLS encapsulate IPv4 packets with header options cannot operate in certain MPLS environments.  While this newly defined LER behavior is mandatory to implement, it is optional to invoke. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6178.txt

This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) that supports sustainable growth while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to the existing routing system.  IRON further addresses other important issues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming, traffic engineering and NAT traversal.  While business considerations are an important determining factor for widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.  This document is a product of the IRTF Routing Research Group.

The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  An expansion in the address space is clearly required.  With its increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools, and it recommends ones that have been found to work well in operational networks in many common situations.

6181	A			RFCs from 2011							"Threat Analysis for TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation with Multiple Addresses" was released in March of 2011 by M. Bagnulo. Multipath TCP (MPTCP for short) describes the extensions proposed for TCP so that endpoints of a given TCP connection can use multiple paths to exchange data.  Such extensions enable the exchange of segments using different source-destination address pairs, resulting in the capability of using multiple paths in a significant number of scenarios.  Some level of multihoming and mobility support can be achieved through these extensions.  However, the support for multiple IP addresses per endpoint may have implications on the security of the resulting MPTCP.  This note includes a threat analysis for MPTCP.

6189	A			RFCs from 2011							"ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP" was released in April of 2011 by P. Zimmermann, J. Callas, and A. Johnston. This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.

This memo describes an RTP payload format for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) as defined in Annex G of ITU-T Recommendation H.264, which is technically identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new media subtype name "H264-SVC", but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184 since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name ("H264") and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.

6192	A			RFCs from 2011							"Protecting the Router Control Plane" was released in March of 2011 by C. Pignataro, R. Dunn, and D. Dugal. This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane from undesired or malicious traffic. In this approach, all legitimate router control plane traffic is identified. Once legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed in the router's forwarding plane. That filter prevents traffic not specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane, or rate-limits such traffic to an acceptable level.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6192.txt

6197	A			RFCs from 2011							"Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Service List Boundary Extension" was released in April of 2011 by K. Wolf. Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) maps service identifiers and location information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available services for a particular location, it will perform a <listServicesByLocation> query to the LoST server.  However, the LoST server, in its response, does not provide context information; that is, it does not provide any additional information about the geographical region within which the returned list of services is considered valid.  Therefore, this document defines a Service List Boundary that returns a local context along with the list of services returned, in order to assist the client in not missing a change in available services when moving.

Francois. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is heavily used in Service Provider networks for both Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services.  For resiliency purposes, redundant routers and BGP sessions can be deployed to reduce the consequences of an Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) or BGP session breakdown on customers' or peers' traffic.  However, simply taking down or even bringing up a BGP session for maintenance purposes may still induce connectivity losses during the BGP convergence.  This is no longer satisfactory for new applications (e.g., voice over IP, online gaming, VPN).  Therefore, a solution is required for the graceful shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s) in order to limit the amount of traffic loss during a planned shutdown.  This document expresses requirements for such a solution.

6206	A			RFCs from 2011							"The Trickle Algorithm" was released in March of 2011 by J. Ko, J. Hui, T. Clausen, O. Gnawali, and P. Levis. The Trickle algorithm allows nodes in a lossy shared medium (e.g., low-power and lossy networks) to exchange information in a highly robust, energy efficient, simple, and scalable manner.  Dynamically adjusting transmission windows allows Trickle to spread new information on the scale of link-layer transmission times while sending only a few messages per hour when information does not change.  A simple suppression mechanism and transmission point selection allow Trickle's communication rate to scale logarithmically with density.  This document describes the Trickle algorithm and considerations in its use. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6206.txt

6211	A			RFCs from 2011							"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithm Identifier Protection Attribute" was released in April of 2011 by J. Schaad. The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), unlike X.509/PKIX certificates, is vulnerable to algorithm substitution attacks.  In an algorithm substitution attack, the attacker changes either the algorithm being used or the parameters of the algorithm in order to change the result of a signature verification process.  In X.509 certificates, the signature algorithm is protected because it is duplicated in the TBSCertificate.signature field with the proviso that the validator is to compare both fields as part of the signature validation process.  This document defines a new attribute that contains a copy of the relevant algorithm identifiers so that they are protected by the signature or authentication process.

McPherson, Internet Architecture Board, and O. Kolkman. Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of commonly defined values that are passed in messages or packets.  To ensure consistent interpretation of these values between independent implementations, there is a need to ensure that the values and associated semantic intent are uniquely defined.  The IETF uses registry functions to record assigned protocol parameter values and their associated semantic intentions.  For each IETF protocol parameter, it is current practice for the IETF to delegate the role of Protocol Parameter Registry Operator to a nominated entity.

6222	A			RFCs from 2011							"Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names (CNAMEs)" was released in April of 2011 by C. Perkins, A. Begen, and D. Wing. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may change if a collision is detected or when the RTP application is restarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP media streams.  For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the participants of an RTP session.  However, the existing guidelines for choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard are insufficient to achieve this uniqueness.  This memo updates those guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP CNAMEs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6222.txt

6241	A			RFCs from 2011							"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)" was released in June of 2011 by A. Bierman, M. Bjorklund, R. Enns, and J. Schoenwaelder. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+4741">RFC 4741</a>. The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defined in this document provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.  It uses an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based data encoding for the configuration data as well as the protocol messages.  The NETCONF protocol operations are realized as remote procedure calls (RPCs).  This document obsoletes RFC 4741. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6241.txt

6243	A			RFCs from 2011							"With-defaults Capability for NETCONF" was released in June of 2011 by A. Bierman, and B. Lengyel. The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defines ways to read and edit configuration data from a NETCONF server.  In some cases, part of this data may not be set by the NETCONF client, but rather a default value known to the server is used instead.  In many situations the NETCONF client has a priori knowledge about default data, so the NETCONF server does not need to save it in a NETCONF configuration datastore or send it to the client in a retrieval operation reply.  In other situations the NETCONF client will need this data from the server.  Not all server implementations treat this default data the same way.  This document defines a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows the NETCONF client to identify how defaults are processed by the server, and also defines new mechanisms for client control of server processing of default data.

6244	A			RFCs from 2011							"An Architecture for Network Management Using NETCONF and YANG" was released in June of 2011 by P. Shafer. The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) gives access to native capabilities of the devices within a network, defining methods for manipulating configuration databases, retrieving operational data, and invoking specific operations. YANG provides the means to define the content carried via NETCONF, both data and operations. Using both technologies, standard modules can be defined to give interoperability and commonality to devices, while still allowing devices to express their unique capabilities.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6244.txt
6245	A			RFCs from 2011							"Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Key Extension for Mobile IPv4" was released in May of 2011 by A. Lior, K. Chowdhury, K. Leung, J. Navali, and P. Yegani. The Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) specification contains a Key field, which MAY contain a value that is used to identify a particular GRE data stream.  This specification defines a new Mobile IP extension that is used to exchange the value to be used in the GRE Key field.  This extension further allows the Mobility Agents to set up the necessary protocol interfaces prior to receiving the mobile node traffic.  The new extension allows a Foreign Agent to request GRE tunneling without disturbing the Home Agent behavior specified for Mobile IPv4.  GRE tunneling with the Key field allows the operators to have home networks that consist of multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which may have overlapping home addresses.  When the tuple <Care of Address, Home Address, and Home Agent Address> is the same across multiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means for the Foreign Agent and Home Agent to identify data streams for the individual sessions based on the GRE key.  In the absence of this key identifier, the data streams cannot be distinguished from each other -- a significant drawback when using IP-in-IP tunneling.

This RFC attempts to document various aspects of the IP service model and how it has evolved over time.  In particular, it attempts to document the properties of the IP layer as they are seen by upper- layer protocols and applications, especially properties that were (and, at times, still are) incorrectly perceived to exist as well as properties that would cause problems if changed.  The discussion of these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.  Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.

Schulzrinne, and A. Dutta. This document describes Media-independent Pre-Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on existing mobility management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms to support inter-domain handover. MPA is a mobile- assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link layer and with any mobility management protocol, and is most applicable to supporting optimization during inter-domain handover. MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow many of the handoff-related operations to take place before the mobile node has moved to the new network. We describe the details of all the associated techniques and their applicability for different scenarios involving various mobility protocols during inter-domain handover. We have implemented the MPA mechanism for various network-layer and application-layer mobility protocols, and we report a summary of experimental performance results in this document.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6252.txt

Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced as a field type in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols.  SDNVs encode an arbitrary-length non-negative integer or arbitrary- length bitstring with minimum overhead.  They are intended to provide protocol flexibility without sacrificing economy and to assist in future-proofing protocols under development.  This document describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with notes on implementation and usage.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.

6258	A			RFCs from 2011							"Delay-Tolerant Networking Metadata Extension Block" was released in May of 2011 by S. Symington. This document defines an extension block that may be used with the Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol.  This Metadata Extension Block is designed to carry additional information that DTN nodes can use to make processing decisions regarding bundles, such as deciding whether to store a bundle or determining to which nodes to forward a bundle.  The metadata that is carried in a metadata block must be formatted according to the metadata type that is identified in the block's metadata type field.  One specific metadata type, for carrying URIs as metadata, is defined in this document.  Other metadata types may be defined in separate documents.

6259	A			RFCs from 2011							"Delay-Tolerant Networking Previous-Hop Insertion Block" was released in May of 2011 by S. Symington. This document defines an extension block for use with the Delay- Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol.  This Previous-Hop Insertion Block (PHIB) extension block is designed to be inserted by a forwarding node to provide the endpoint identifier (EID) of an endpoint of which the forwarding node is a member so that this EID may be conveyed to the next-hop receiving node.  Knowledge of an EID of an endpoint of which a previous-hop node is a member may be required in some circumstances to support certain routing protocols (e.g., flood routing).  If this EID cannot be provided by the convergence layer or other means, the PHIB defines the mechanism whereby the EID can be provided with the bundle.  Each PHIB is always removed from the bundle by the receiving node so that its presence within the bundle is limited to exactly one hop.  This document defines the format and processing of this PHIB.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.

Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable. Host-based transition mechanisms used in dual-stack environments cannot meet all transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational changes required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6264.txt

This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

One aspect of network mobility support is the assignment of a prefix or prefixes to a mobile router for use on the links in the mobile network.  This document specifies how DHCPv6 prefix delegation can be used for this configuration task.  The mobile router plays the role of requesting router, while the home agent assumes the role of delegating router.  When the mobile router is outside its home network, the mobile router also assumes the role of DHCPv6 relay agent, co-located with the requesting router function.

6285	A			RFCs from 2011							"Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions" was released in June of 2011 by T. Van Caenegem, A. Begen, B. Ver Steeg, and Z. Vax. When an RTP receiver joins a multicast session, it may need to acquire and parse certain Reference Information before it can process any data sent in the multicast session. Depending on the join time, length of the Reference Information repetition (or appearance) interval, size of the Reference Information, and the application and transport properties, the time lag before an RTP receiver can usefully consume the multicast data, which we refer to as the Acquisition Delay, varies and can be large. This is an undesirable phenomenon for receivers that frequently switch among different multicast sessions, such as video broadcasts.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6285.txt
6286	A			RFCs from 2011							"Autonomous-System-Wide Unique BGP Identifier for BGP-4" was released in June of 2011 by E. Chen, and J. Yuan.

6306	A			RFCs from 2011							"Hierarchical IPv4 Framework" was released in July of 2011 by P. Frejborg. This document describes a framework for how the current IPv4 address space can be divided into two new address categories: a core address space (Area Locators, ALOCs) that is globally unique, and an edge address space (Endpoint Locators, ELOCs) that is regionally unique. In the future, the ELOC space will only be significant in a private network or in a service provider domain. Therefore, a 32x32 bit addressing scheme and a hierarchical routing architecture are achieved. The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the current IPv4 Internet.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6306.txt

6329	A			RFCs from 2012							"IS-IS Extensions Supporting IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging" was released in April of 2012 by D. Allan, P. Ashwood-Smith, D. Fedyk, A. Bragg, and P. Unbehagen. 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) has been standardized by the IEEE as the next step in the evolution of the various spanning tree and registration protocols.  802.1aq allows for true shortest path forwarding in a mesh Ethernet network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths.  This permits it to support much larger Layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh topology.  Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership, which includes point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint variations.  This memo documents the IS-IS changes required to support this IEEE protocol and provides some context and examples. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6329.txt

6332	A			RFCs from 2011							"Multicast Acquisition Report Block Type for RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs)" was released in July of 2011 by E. Friedrich, and A. Begen. In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter- related data.  Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP receivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right after they join the session.  Thus, they often experience a random acquisition delay.  An RTP receiver can use one or more different approaches to achieve rapid acquisition.  Yet, due to various factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies.  Furthermore, in some cases, the RTP receiver can do a simple multicast join (in other cases, it is compelled to do so).  For quality reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic purposes, it is important to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers about their acquisition and presentation experiences.  This document addresses this issue by defining a new report block type, called the Multicast Acquisition (MA) report block, within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs) (RFC 3611).  This document also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6332.txt

The Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) AS1, AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption of EDIINT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport.  Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message.  This Informational RFC describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDIINT transport message.  The attachments are stored within the MIME multipart/related structure.  A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.

This document describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes with applications in public and private IP networks to provide protection against packet loss.  The framework supports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable transport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming, media.  This framework can be used to define Content Delivery Protocols that provide FEC for streaming media delivery or other packet flows.  Content Delivery Protocols defined using this framework can support any FEC scheme (and associated FEC codes) that is compliant with various requirements defined in this document.  Thus, Content Delivery Protocols can be defined that are not specific to a particular FEC scheme, and FEC schemes can be defined that are not specific to a particular Content Delivery Protocol.

6376	A			RFCs from 2011							"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures" was released in September of 2011 by M. Kucherawy, T. Hansen, and D. Crocker. DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating the domain with the message. This can be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6376.txt

6401	A			RFCs from 2011							"RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority" was released in October of 2011 by F. Le Faucheur, K. Carlberg, and J. Polk. Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of network congestion. When supported over the Internet Protocol suite, this may be facilitated through a network-layer admission control solution that supports prioritized access to resources (e.g., bandwidth). These resources may be explicitly set aside for prioritized sessions, or may be shared with other sessions. This document specifies extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) that can be used to support such an admission priority capability at the network layer.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6401.txt

Niccolini, and J. Seedorf. The Session PEERing for Multimedia INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) working group (WG) provides a peering framework that leverages the building blocks of existing IETF-defined protocols such as SIP and ENUM for the interconnection between SIP Service Providers (SSPs).  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate SPEERMINT- specific threat vectors and to give guidance for implementers on selecting appropriate countermeasures.  Security requirements for SPEERMINT that have been derived from the threats detailed in this document can be found in RFC 6271; this document provides concrete countermeasures to meet those SPEERMINT security requirements.  In this document, the different security threats related to SPEERMINT are classified into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), the Location Routing Function (LRF), the Signaling Function (SF), and the Media Function (MF) of a specific SIP Service Provider.  Various instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the classification.  Finally, existing security solutions for SIP and RTP/RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) are presented to describe countermeasures currently available for such threats.  Each SSP may have connections to one or more remote SSPs through peering or transit contracts.  A potentially compromised remote SSP that attacks other SSPs is out of the scope of this document; this document focuses on attacks on an SSP from outside the trust domain such an SSP may have with other SSPs.

6480	A			RFCs from 2012							"An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing" was released in February of 2012 by S. Kent, and M. Lepinski. This document describes an architecture for an infrastructure to support improved security of Internet routing.  The foundation of this architecture is a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) that represents the allocation hierarchy of IP address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers; and a distributed repository system for storing and disseminating the data objects that comprise the RPKI, as well as other signed objects necessary for improved routing security.  As an initial application of this architecture, the document describes how a legitimate holder of IP address space can explicitly and verifiably authorize one or more ASes to originate routes to that address space.  Such verifiable authorizations could be used, for example, to more securely construct BGP route filters.

This document defines a "manifest" for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A manifest is a signed object (file) that contains a listing of all the signed objects (files) in the repository publication point (directory) associated with an authority responsible for publishing in the repository.  For each certificate, Certificate Revocation List (CRL), or other type of signed objects issued by the authority that are published at this repository publication point, the manifest contains both the name of the file containing the object and a hash of the file content.  Manifests are intended to enable a relying party (RP) to detect certain forms of attacks against a repository.  Specifically, if an RP checks a manifest's contents against the signed objects retrieved from a repository publication point, then the RP can detect "stale" (valid) data and deletion of signed objects.

SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing Neighbor Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats.  As defined today, SEND assumes that the node sending an ND message is the owner of the address from which the message is sent and/or possesses a key that authorizes the node to act as a router, so that it is in possession of the private key or keys used to generate the digital signature on each message.  This means that the Proxy ND signaling performed by nodes that do not possess knowledge of the address owner's private key and/or knowledge of a router's key cannot be secured using SEND.

To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers originate BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN ("MCAST-VPN") BGP routes; they also originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-specific attributes.  These routes encode addresses from the customer's address space, as well as addresses from the provider's address space.  These two address spaces are independent, and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the same.  These routes always contain an "address family" field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.  To ensure interoperability, this document specifies that provider IPv4 addresses are always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet addresses, and that the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by the length of the address field.

6518	A			RFCs from 2012							"Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines" was released in February of 2012 by G. Lebovitz, and M. Bhatia. This document is one of a series concerned with defining a roadmap of protocol specification work for the use of modern cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms for message authentication in routing protocols.  In particular, it defines the framework for a key management protocol that may be used to create and manage session keys for message authentication and integrity.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6518.txt
6519	A			RFCs from 2012							"RADIUS Extensions for Dual-Stack Lite" was released in February of 2012 by A. Durand, and R. Maglione. Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers that are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix.  Dual-Stack Lite requires pre-configuration of the Dual-Stack Lite Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) tunnel information on the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.  In many networks, the customer profile information may be stored in Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, while client configurations are mainly provided through the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry the Dual-Stack Lite AFTR tunnel name; the RADIUS attribute is defined based on the equivalent DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME option.  This RADIUS attribute is meant to be used between the RADIUS server and the Network Access Server (NAS); it is not intended to be used directly between the B4 element and the RADIUS server.

6521	A			RFCs from 2012							"Home Agent-Assisted Route Optimization between Mobile IPv4 Networks" was released in February of 2012 by J. Korhonen, and A. Makela. This document describes a home agent-assisted route optimization functionality for the IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol.  The function is designed to facilitate optimal routing in cases where all nodes are connected to a single home agent; thus, the use case is route optimization within a single organization or similar entity.  The functionality enables the discovery of eligible peer nodes (based on information received from the home agent) and their network prefixes, and the establishment of a direct tunnel between such nodes.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6521.txt
6522	A			RFCs from 2012							"The Multipart/Report Media Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages" was released in January of 2012 by M. Kucherawy. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+3462">RFC 3462</a>. The multipart/report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) media type is a general "family" or "container" type for electronic mail reports of any kind. Although this memo defines only the use of the multipart/report media type with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit if a single media type is used for all kinds of reports.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6522.txt
6525	A			RFCs from 2012							"Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Stream Reconfiguration" was released in February of 2012 by R. Stewart, P. Lei, and M. Tuexen. Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) want the ability to "reset" a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application layer that the reset has been performed.  Applications requiring this feature want it so that they can "reuse" streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to "reset the streams back to zero".  This document also includes methods for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers.

6529	A			RFCs from 2012							"Host/Host Protocol for the ARPA Network" was released in April of 2012 by S. Crocker, and A. McKenzie. This document reproduces the Host/Host Protocol developed by the ARPA Network Working Group during 1969, 1970, and 1971.  It describes a protocol used to manage communication between processes residing on independent Hosts.  It addresses issues of multiplexing multiple streams of communication (including addressing, flow control, connection establishment/disestablishment, and other signaling) over a single hardware interface.  It was the official protocol of the ARPA Network from January 1972 until the switch to TCP/IP in January 1983.  It is offered as an RFC at this late date to help complete the historical record available through the RFC series.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for the historical record.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6529.txt
6530	A			RFCs from 2012							"Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email" was released in February of 2012 by J. Klensin, and Y. Ko. Full use of electronic mail throughout the world requires that (subject to other constraints) people be able to use close variations on their own names (written correctly in their own languages and scripts) as mailbox names in email addresses.  This document introduces a series of specifications that define mechanisms and protocol extensions needed to fully support internationalized email addresses.  These changes include an SMTP extension and extension of email header syntax to accommodate UTF-8 data.  The document set also includes discussion of key assumptions and issues in deploying fully internationalized email.  This document is a replacement for RFC 4952; it reflects additional issues identified since that document was published. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6530.txt

Internet mail was originally limited to 7-bit ASCII. MIME added support for the use of 8-bit character sets in body parts, and also defined an encoded-word construct so other character sets could be used in certain header field values. However, full internationalization of electronic mail requires additional enhancements to allow the use of Unicode, including characters outside the ASCII repertoire, in mail addresses as well as direct use of Unicode in header fields like "From:", "To:", and "Subject:", without requiring the use of complex encoded-word constructs. This document specifies an enhancement to the Internet Message Format and to MIME that allows use of Unicode in mail addresses and most header field content.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6532.txt
6533	A			RFCs from 2012							"Internationalized Delivery Status and Disposition Notifications" was released in February of 2012 by A. Melnikov, C. Newman, and T. Hansen. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+5337">RFC 5337</a>. Delivery status notifications (DSNs) are critical to the correct operation of an email system. However, the existing Draft Standards (RFC 3461, RFC 3464, RFC 6522) are presently limited to ASCII text in the machine-readable portions of the protocol. This specification adds a new address type for international email addresses so an original recipient address with non-ASCII characters can be correctly preserved even after downgrading. This also provides updated content return media types for delivery status notifications and message disposition notifications to support use of the new address type.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6533.txt
6534	A			RFCs from 2012							"Loss Episode Metrics for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)" was released in May of 2012 by J. Sommers, A. Morton, and N. Duffield. The IETF has developed a one-way packet loss metric that measures the loss rate on a Poisson and Periodic probe streams between two hosts.  However, the impact of packet loss on applications is, in general, sensitive not just to the average loss rate but also to the way in which packet losses are distributed in loss episodes (i.e., maximal sets of consecutively lost probe packets).  This document defines one-way packet loss episode metrics, specifically, the frequency and average duration of loss episodes and a probing methodology under which the loss episode metrics are to be measured.

6535	A			RFCs from 2012							"Dual-Stack Hosts Using "Bump-in-the-Host" (BIH)" was released in February of 2012 by T. Savolainen, B. Huang, and H. Deng. Bump-in-the-Host (BIH) is a host-based IPv4 to IPv6 protocol translation mechanism that allows a class of IPv4-only applications that work through NATs to communicate with IPv6-only peers.  The host on which applications are running may be connected to IPv6-only or dual-stack access networks.  BIH hides IPv6 and makes the IPv4-only applications think they are talking with IPv4 peers by local synthesis of IPv4 addresses.  This document obsoletes RFC 2767 and RFC 3338.

The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) requires a structured and secure operating environment that promotes human usability and multi-vendor interoperability.  There is a need for standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF protocol access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.  This document defines such an access control model. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6536.txt

6539	A			RFCs from 2012							"IBAKE: Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange" was released in March of 2012 by I. Broustis, G. Sundaram, and V. Cakulev. Cryptographic protocols based on public-key methods have been traditionally based on certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to support certificate management.  The emerging field of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) protocols allows simplification of infrastructure requirements via a Private-Key Generator (PKG) while providing the same flexibility.  However, one significant limitation of IBE methods is that the PKG can end up being a de facto key escrow server, with undesirable consequences.  Another observed deficiency is a lack of mutual authentication of communicating parties.  This document specifies the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) protocol.  IBAKE does not suffer from the key escrow problem and in addition provides mutual authentication as well as perfect forward and backward secrecy.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6539.txt
6540	A			RFCs from 2012							"IPv6 Support Required for All IP-Capable Nodes" was released in April of 2012 by L. Howard, C. Liljenstolpe, C. Donley, and W. George. Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document advises that IPv6 support is no longer considered optional.  It also cautions that there are places in existing IETF documents where the term "IP" is used in a way that could be misunderstood by implementers as the term "IP" becomes a generic that can mean IPv4 + IPv6, IPv6-only, or IPv4-only, depending on context and application.

Currently, channel bindings are implemented using an MD5 hash in the Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanism (RFC 4121).  This document updates RFC 4121 to allow channel bindings using algorithms negotiated based on Kerberos crypto framework as defined in RFC 3961.  In addition, because this update makes use of the last extensible field in the Kerberos client-server exchange message, extensions are defined to allow future protocol extensions.

6543	A			RFCs from 2012							"Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifier for Proxy Mobile IPv6" was released in May of 2012 by S. Gundavelli. Proxy Mobile IPv6 (RFC 5213) requires that all mobile access gateways use a fixed link-local address and a fixed link-layer address on any of their access links that they share with mobile nodes.  This requirement was intended to ensure that a mobile node does not detect any change with respect to its Layer 3 attachment, even after it roams from one mobile access gateway to another.  In the absence of any reserved addresses for this use, coordination across vendors and manual configuration of these addresses on all of the mobility elements in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain are required.  This document attempts to simplify this operational requirement by making a reservation for special addresses that can be used for this purpose.  This document also updates RFC 5213.

6544	A			RFCs from 2012							"TCP Candidates with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)" was released in March of 2012 by B. B. Lowekamp, A. Keranen, J. Rosenberg, and A. B. Roach. Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the offer/answer model of session negotiation.  ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport addresses for each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity checks based on Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  ICE provides a general framework for describing candidates but only defines UDP-based media streams.  This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the ability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single stream.

Security incidents, such as system compromises, worms, viruses, phishing incidents, and denial of service, typically result in the loss of service, data, and resources both human and system.  Service providers and Computer Security Incident Response Teams need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating and tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack.  Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network communication method to facilitate sharing incident-handling data while integrating existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms for a complete incident-handling solution.  Combining these capabilities in a communication system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks.  Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the security recommendations and considerations.  This document obsoletes RFC 6045.

Brandt, J. Hui, R. Struik, and R. Alexander. Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550.txt

Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared with traditional wired and ad hoc networks that require the specification of new routing metrics and constraints.  By contrast, with typical Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or link metrics, this document specifies a set of link and node routing metrics and constraints suitable to LLNs to be used by the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL).

Hui, and D. Culler. In Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers may limit them to maintaining, at most, a few routes.  In some configurations, it is necessary to use these memory-constrained routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g., the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or a few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory-constrained routers.  This document specifies a new IPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPL routing domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6554.txt

When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.

The amount of time it takes to establish a session using common transport APIs in dual-stack networks and networks with filtering such as proposed in BCP 38 is a barrier to IPv6 deployment.  This note describes a test that can be used to determine whether an application can reliably establish sessions quickly in a complex environment such as dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) deployment or IPv6 deployment with multiple prefixes and upstream ingress filtering.  This test is not a test of a specific algorithm, but of the external behavior of the system as a black box.  Any algorithm that has the intended external behavior will be accepted by it.

6561	A			RFCs from 2012							"Recommendations for the Remediation of Bots in ISP Networks" was released in March of 2012 by N. Mody, J. Livingood, and M. O'Reirdan. This document contains recommendations on how Internet Service Providers can use various remediation techniques to manage the effects of malicious bot infestations on computers used by their subscribers.  Internet users with infected computers are exposed to risks such as loss of personal data and increased susceptibility to online fraud.  Such computers can also become inadvertent participants in or components of an online crime network, spam network, and/or phishing network as well as be used as a part of a distributed denial-of-service attack.  Mitigating the effects of and remediating the installations of malicious bots will make it more difficult for botnets to operate and could reduce the level of online crime on the Internet in general and/or on a particular Internet Service Provider's network.

Many Service Providers (SPs) offer Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to their customers using a technique in which Customer Edge (CE) routers are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers.  The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the provider's backbone.  Support currently exists for both IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs; however, only Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) as PE-CE protocol is specified.  This document extends those specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE routing protocol.  The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to that of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6565.txt

6575	A			RFCs from 2012							"Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Mediation for IP Interworking of Layer 2 VPNs" was released in June of 2012 by H. Shah, G. Heron, E. Rosen, and V. Kompella. The Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), detailed in RFC 4664, provides point-to-point connections between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does so by binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device with a Provider Edge (PE) device) to a pseudowire (connecting the two PEs).  In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of the same technology (e.g., both Ethernet or both ATM), and the pseudowire must carry the frames of that technology.  However, if it is known that the frames' payload consists solely of IP datagrams, it is possible to provide a point-to-point connection in which the pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies.  This requires the PEs to perform a function known as "Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Mediation".  ARP Mediation refers to the process of resolving Layer 2 addresses when different resolution protocols are used on either Attachment Circuit.  The methods described in this document are applicable even when the CEs run a routing protocol between them, as long as the routing protocol runs over IP.

RFC 5681 documents the following four intertwined TCP congestion control algorithms: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.  RFC 5681 explicitly allows certain modifications of these algorithms, including modifications that use the TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) option (RFC 2883), and modifications that respond to "partial acknowledgments" (ACKs that cover new data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was detected) in the absence of SACK.  This document describes a specific algorithm for responding to partial acknowledgments, referred to as "NewReno".  This response to partial acknowledgments was first proposed by Janey Hoe.

6583	A			RFCs from 2012							"Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems" was released in March of 2012 by J. Jaeggli, W. Kumari, and I. Gashinsky. In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover the actual number of machines on the subnet. In contrast, the default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers trillions of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be unassigned. Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to deliberate or accidental denial of service (DoS), whereby they attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers of unassigned addresses. Such denial-of-service attacks can be launched intentionally (by an attacker) or result from legitimate operational tools or accident conditions. As a result of these vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to "join" a network, it may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6 transported flows may be interrupted.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6583.txt

The first scheme is based on RSA Digital Signatures.  The second scheme relies on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  The third scheme relies on a Group- keyed Message Authentication Code (MAC).  Finally, the fourth scheme merges the Digital Signature and group schemes.  These schemes have different target use cases, and they do not all provide the same service. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6584.txt

6601	A			RFCs from 2012							"Generic Connection Admission Control (GCAC) Algorithm Specification for IP/MPLS Networks" was released in April of 2012 by D. McDysan, and G. Ash. This document presents a generic connection admission control (GCAC) reference model and algorithm for IP-/MPLS-based networks.  Service provider (SP) IP/MPLS networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to reject Voice over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect calls already in progress.  Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will suffer degraded quality.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented in vendor equipment and deployed by service providers.  MPLS GCAC interoperates between vendor equipment and across multiple service provider domains.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm uses available standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm does not include aspects of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations, such as detailed path selection mechanisms.  MPLS GCAC functions are implemented in a distributed manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for specified QoS constraints.  The objective is that the source is able to compute a source route with high likelihood that via-elements along the selected path will in fact admit the request.  In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)), this objective cannot always be met, but this document summarizes methods that partially meet this objective.  MPLS GCAC is applicable to any service or flow that must meet an objective QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) for a specified quantity of traffic.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6601.txt

For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification requires the mobile access gateway to send a Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor on a per-session basis.  In the absence of signaling semantics for performing operations with group-specific scope, this results in a significant amount of signaling traffic on a periodic basis between a given mobile access gateway and a local mobility anchor.

Gomez, and E. Kim. IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) are formed by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format specification defines how mesh topologies could be obtained and maintained. Thus, it should be considered how 6LoWPAN formation and multi-hop routing could be supported.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6606.txt

Patil, J. Korhonen, and D. Kroeselberg. Mobile IPv6 signaling between a Mobile Node (MN) and its Home Agent (HA) is secured using IPsec.  The security association (SA) between an MN and the HA is established using Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) version 1 or 2.  The security model specified for Mobile IPv6, which relies on IKE/IPsec, requires interaction between the Mobile IPv6 protocol component and the IKE/IPsec module of the IP stack.  This document proposes an alternate security framework for Mobile IPv6 and Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6, which relies on Transport Layer Security for establishing keying material and other bootstrapping parameters required to protect Mobile IPv6 signaling and data traffic between the MN and HA.

6621	A			RFCs from 2012							"Simplified Multicast Forwarding" was released in May of 2012 by J. Macker. This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) mechanism that provides basic Internet Protocol (IP) multicast forwarding suitable for limited wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) use.  It is mainly applicable in situations where efficient flooding represents an acceptable engineering design trade-off.  It defines techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection (DPD), to be applied in the forwarding process, for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol use.  This document also specifies optional mechanisms for using reduced relay sets to achieve more efficient multicast data distribution within a mesh topology as compared to Classic Flooding.  Interactions with other protocols, such as use of information provided by concurrently running unicast routing protocols or interaction with other multicast protocols, as well as multiple deployment approaches are also described.  Distributed algorithms for selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion are provided in the appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast MANET border routers are discussed, but ongoing work remains in this area and is beyond the scope of this document.

6624	A			RFCs from 2012							"Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks Using BGP for Auto-Discovery and Signaling" was released in May of 2012 by K. Kompella, B. Kothari, and R. Cherukuri. Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM circuits have been around a long time; more recently, Ethernet VPNs, including Virtual Private LAN Service, have become popular.  Traditional L2VPNs often required a separate Service Provider infrastructure for each type and yet another for the Internet and IP VPNs.  In addition, L2VPN provisioning was cumbersome.  This document presents a new approach to the problem of offering L2VPN services where the L2VPN customer's experience is virtually identical to that offered by traditional L2VPNs, but such that a Service Provider can maintain a single network for L2VPNs, IP VPNs, and the Internet, as well as a common provisioning methodology for all services.

6625	A			RFCs from 2012							"Wildcards in Multicast VPN Auto-Discovery Routes" was released in May of 2012 by W. Hendrickx, Y. Rekhter, E. Rosen, and R. Qiu. In Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs), customer multicast flows are carried in "tunnels" through a service provider's network.  The base specifications for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN "auto-discovery routes" and specify how to use an auto-discovery route to advertise the fact that an individual customer multicast flow is being carried in a particular tunnel.  However, those specifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple customer flows are being carried in a single tunnel.  Those specifications also do not provide a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default to carry all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all the provider edge routers of the MVPN.  This document eliminates these restrictions by specifying the use of "wildcard" elements in the customer flow identifiers.  With wildcard elements, a single auto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer flows or even to all customer flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6625.txt

The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. On every link in the PCN-domain, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes provide decision points with information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets that allows them to take decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request, and to terminate some already admitted flows during serious \%pre-congestion.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6627.txt
6628	A			RFCs from 2012							"Efficient Augmented Password-Only Authentication and Key Exchange for IKEv2" was released in June of 2012 by K. Kobara, and S. Shin. This document describes an efficient augmented password-only authentication and key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy password and its verifier is registered in the intended server.  In general, the user password is chosen from a small set of dictionary words that allows an attacker to perform exhaustive searches (i.e., off-line dictionary attacks).  The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure against passive attacks, active attacks, and off-line dictionary attacks (on the obtained messages with passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance to server compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE security).  In addition, this document describes how the AugPAKE protocol is integrated into the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).

In a large RTP session using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback mechanism defined in RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once.  This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending duplicate feedback reports.  However, there are cases where it is not recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback implosion.  This memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP Third-Party Loss Report that can be used to inform receivers that the feedback target is aware of some loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback.

6646	A			RFCs from 2012							"DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) Problem Statement" was released in July of 2012 by Y. Yang, N. Zong, H. Song, and R. Alimi. Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  In P2P applications, one technique for reducing the transit and uplink P2P traffic is to introduce storage capabilities within the network.  Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches) provide such storage, but they can be complex (e.g., P2P caches need to explicitly support individual P2P application protocols), and do not allow users to manage resource usage policies for content in the cache.  This document discusses the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications and shows the need for a standard protocol for accessing this storage.

It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+1510">RFC 1510</a>. The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally specified in RFC 1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption.  Almost 30 years after first publishing DES, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established consensus that DES is insufficiently secure.  By 2008, commercial hardware costing less than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in less than a day on average.  DES is long past its sell-by date.  Accordingly, this document updates RFC 1964, RFC 4120, RFC 4121, and RFC 4757 to deprecate the use of DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP, and other weak cryptographic algorithms in Kerberos.  Because RFC 1510 (obsoleted by RFC 4120) supports only DES, this document recommends the reclassification of RFC 1510 as Historic.

6653	A			RFCs from 2012							"DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Networks" was released in July of 2012 by F. Xia, B. Sarikaya, and T. Lemon. As interest in IPv6 deployment in cellular networks increases, several migration issues have been being raised; IPv6 prefix management is the issue addressed in this document.  Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to address such prefix management issues as an access router offloading delegation of prefixes and release tasks to a DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The access router may next do stateless or stateful address allocation to the mobile node, e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.  We also describe prefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers.

6654	A			RFCs from 2012							"Gateway-Initiated IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (GI 6rd)" was released in July of 2012 by C. Zhou, T. Tsou, T. Taylor, and Q. Chen. This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels.  6rd requires support by a device (the 6rd customer edge, or 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge rather than from customer equipment, and hence is termed "Gateway-initiated 6rd" (GI 6rd).  The advantages of this approach are that it requires no modification to customer equipment and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth environment.

6659	A			RFCs from 2012							"Considerations for Deploying the Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) Method" was released in July of 2012 by A. Begen. The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution is a method based on RTP and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables an RTP receiver to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicast data.  Upon a request from the RTP receiver, an auxiliary unicast RTP retransmission session is set up between a retransmission server and the RTP receiver, over which the reference information about the new multicast stream the RTP receiver is about to join is transmitted at an accelerated rate.  This often precedes, but may also accompany, the multicast stream itself.  When there is only one multicast stream to be acquired, the RAMS solution works in a straightforward manner.  However, when there are two or more multicast streams to be acquired from the same or different multicast RTP sessions, care should be taken to configure each RAMS session appropriately.  This document provides example scenarios and discusses how the RAMS solution could be used in such scenarios.

The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. The overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN- domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes pass information about these PCN-marks to Decision Points that then decide whether to admit or block new flow requests or to terminate some already admitted flows during serious pre-congestion.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6660.txt

Taylor. Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This memo describes the requirements for the signaling applied within the PCN-domain: (1) PCN-feedback-information is carried from the PCN-egress-node to the Decision Point; (2) the Decision Point may ask the PCN-ingress-node to measure, and report back, the rate of sent PCN-traffic between that PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-node.  The Decision Point may be either collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or a centralized node (in the first case, (2) is not required).

Annex E of the Digital Video Broadcasting - IPTV (DVB-IPTV) technical specification defines an optional Application-Layer Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) protocol to protect the streaming media transported using RTP.  The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol uses two layers for FEC protection.  The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D interleaved parity code.  The second (enhancement) layer is based on the Raptor code.  By offering a layered approach, the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol offers good protection against both bursty and random packet losses at a cost of decent complexity.

6688	A			RFCs from 2012							"Parallel NFS (pNFS) Block Disk Protection" was released in July of 2012 by S. Faibish, J. Glasgow, and D. Black. Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) to enable direct client access to file data on storage devices and bypass the NFSv4 server.  This can increase both performance and parallelism, but it requires additional client functionality, some of which depends upon the type of storage used.  The pNFS specification for block storage (RFC 5663) describes how clients can identify the volumes used for pNFS, but this mechanism requires communication with the NFSv4 server.  This document updates RFC 5663 to add a mechanism that enables identification of block storage devices used by pNFS file systems without communicating with the server.  This enables clients to control access to pNFS block devices when the client initially boots, as opposed to waiting until the client can communicate with the NFSv4 server.

6696	A			RFCs from 2012							"EAP Extensions for the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)" was released in July of 2012 by B. He, G. Zorn, Z. Cao, Y. Shi, and Q. Wu. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+5296">RFC 5296</a>. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework supporting multiple types of authentication methods.  In systems where EAP is used for authentication, it is desirable to avoid repeating the entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.  This document specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re- authentication between the peer and an EAP re-authentication server through any authenticator.  The re-authentication server may be in the home network or in the local network to which the peer is connecting. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6696.txt
6697	A			RFCs from 2012							"Handover Keying (HOKEY) Architecture Design" was released in July of 2012 by Y. Nir, G. Zorn, S. Decugis, K. Hoeper, Q. Wu, and T. Taylor. The Handover Keying (HOKEY) Working Group seeks to minimize handover delay due to authentication when a peer moves from one point of attachment to another. Work has progressed on two different approaches to reduce handover delay: early authentication (so that authentication does not need to be performed during handover), and reuse of cryptographic material generated during an initial authentication to save time during re-authentication. A basic assumption is that the mobile host or "peer" is initially authenticated using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), executed between the peer and an EAP server as defined in RFC 3748.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6697.txt
6698	A			RFCs from 2012							"The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA" was released in August of 2012 by J. Schlyter, and P. Hoffman. Encrypted communication on the Internet often uses Transport Layer Security (TLS), which depends on third parties to certify the keys used.  This document improves on that situation by enabling the administrators of domain names to specify the keys used in that domain's TLS servers.  This requires matching improvements in TLS client software, but no change in TLS server software. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6698.txt

6702	A			RFCs from 2012							"Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Disclosure Rules" was released in August of 2012 by P. Saint-Andre, and T. Polk. The disclosure process for intellectual property rights (IPR) in documents produced within the IETF stream is essential to the accurate development of community consensus.  However, this process is not always followed by IETF participants.  Regardless of the cause or motivation, noncompliance with IPR disclosure rules can delay or even derail completion of IETF specifications.  This document describes some strategies for promoting compliance with the IPR disclosure rules.  These strategies are primarily intended for use by area directors, working group chairs, and working group secretaries.

6705	A			RFCs from 2012							"Localized Routing for Proxy Mobile IPv6" was released in September of 2012 by R. Koodli, P. Loureiro, A. Dutta, Q. Wu, and S. Krishnan. Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management protocol that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.  PMIPv6 requires all communications to go through the local mobility anchor.  As this can be suboptimal, Localized Routing (LR) allows Mobile Nodes (MNs) attached to the same or different Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs) to route traffic by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways.  This document proposes initiation, utilization, and termination mechanisms for localized routing between mobile access gateways within a proxy mobile IPv6 domain.  It defines two new signaling messages, Localized Routing Initiation (LRI) and Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA), that are used to realize this mechanism.

6706	A			RFCs from 2012							"Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO)" was released in August of 2012 by F. Templin. Nodes attached to common multi-access link types (e.g., multicast- capable, shared media, non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA), etc.) can exchange packets as neighbors on the link, but they may not always be provisioned with sufficient routing information for optimal neighbor selection.  Such nodes should therefore be able to discover a trusted intermediate router on the link that provides both forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services to inform the node of an on-link neighbor that is closer to the final destination.  This redirection can provide a useful route optimization, since the triangular path from the ingress link neighbor, to the intermediate router, and finally to the egress link neighbor may be considerably longer than the direct path from ingress to egress.  However, ordinary redirection may lead to operational issues on certain link types and/or in certain deployment scenarios.  This document therefore introduces an Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) capability that addresses the issues.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6706.txt
6707	A			RFCs from 2012							"Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Problem Statement" was released in September of 2012 by F. Le Faucheur, B. Niven-Jenkins, and N. Bitar. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits for cacheable content: reduced delivery cost, improved quality of experience for End Users, and increased robustness of delivery. For these reasons, they are frequently used for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN Providers are scaling up their infrastructure, and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a given content item can be delivered to an End User regardless of that End User's location or attachment network. This is the motivation for interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to End Users. However, no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate such CDN Interconnection.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6707.txt

Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as pieces of information or server processes that are available in several equivalent replicas on different hosts. This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource. This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance. The ultimate goal is to improve performance or Quality of Experience in the application while reducing the utilization of the underlying network infrastructure.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6708.txt

This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.txt
6750	A			RFCs from 2012							"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage" was released in October of 2012 by D. Hardt, and M. Jones. This specification describes how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources.  Any party in possession of a bearer token (a "bearer") can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).  To prevent misuse, bearer tokens need to be protected from disclosure in storage and in transport. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.txt
6751	A			RFCs from 2012							"Native IPv6 behind IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT Customer Premises Equipment (6a44)" was released in October of 2012 by B. Carpenter, S. Jiang, D. Wing, and R. Despres. In customer sites having IPv4-only Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), Teredo (RFC 4380, RFC 5991, RFC 6081) provides last-resort IPv6 connectivity.  However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet Service Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of NAT types).  6a44 is a complementary solution that, being based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of 6a44 IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the beginning of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned by local ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures)).  The specification is expected to be complete enough for running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally deployed and used.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6751.txt
6752	A			RFCs from 2012							"Issues with Private IP Addressing in the Internet" was released in September of 2012 by A. Kirkham. The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the potential problems of using private, RFC 1918, or non-globally routable addressing within the core of a Service Provider (SP) network.  The discussion focuses on link addresses and, to a small extent, loopback addresses.  While many of the issues are well recognised within the ISP community, there appears to be no document that collectively describes the issues.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6752.txt
6753	A			RFCs from 2012							"A Location Dereference Protocol Using HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)" was released in October of 2012 by H. Tschofenig, J. Winterbottom, H. Schulzrinne, and M. Thomson. This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS) as a dereference protocol to resolve a reference to a Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO).  This document assumes that a Location Recipient possesses a URI that can be used in conjunction with the HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol to request the location of the Target.

6754	A			RFCs from 2012							"Protocol Independent Multicast Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) Redirect" was released in October of 2012 by V. Arya, H. Ou, L. Wei, S. Jethwani, and Y. Cai. A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) procedure to select an upstream interface and router in order to build forwarding state.  When there are equal cost multipaths (ECMPs), existing implementations often use hash algorithms to select a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP selection to be based on administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays, path preferences, and routing metrics.

6756	A			RFCs from 2012							"Internet Engineering Task Force and International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector Collaboration Guidelines" was released in September of 2012 by E. Lear, G. Fishman, S. Bradner, and S. Trowbridge. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+3356">RFC 3356</a>. This document provides guidance to aid in the understanding of collaboration on standards development between the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) of the Internet Society (ISOC). It is an update of and obsoletes RFC 3356. The updates reflect changes in the IETF and ITU-T since RFC 3356 was written. The bulk of this document is common text with ITU-T A Series Supplement 3 (07/2012).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6756.txt
6757	A			RFCs from 2012							"Access Network Identifier (ANI) Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6" was released in October of 2012 by R. Pazhyannur, J. Korhonen, S. Gundavelli, K. Leung, and M. Grayson. The local mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain is able to provide access-network- and access-operator-specific handling or policing of the mobile node traffic using information about the access network to which the mobile node is attached.  This specification defines a mechanism and a related mobility option for carrying the access network identifier and the access operator identification information from the mobile access gateway to the local mobility anchor over Proxy Mobile IPv6.

6769	A			RFCs from 2012							"Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA)" was released in October of 2012 by R. Raszuk, L. Zhang, A. Lo, J. Heitz, and X. Xu. All BGP routers in the Default-Free Zone (DFZ) are required to carry all routes in the Default-Free Routing Table (DFRT). This document describes a technique, Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA), that allows some BGP routers not to install all of those routes into the Forwarding Information Base (FIB).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6769.txt
6771	A			RFCs from 2012							"Considerations for Having a Successful "Bar BOF" Side Meeting" was released in October of 2012 by L. Eggert, and G. Camarillo. New work is typically brought to the IETF by a group of interested individuals. IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to hold informal get-togethers to discuss and develop their ideas. Such side meetings, which are not reflected in the IETF meeting agenda and have no official status, are often half-jokingly referred to as "bar BOF" sessions to acknowledge that some of them may eventually lead to a proposal for an official IETF BOF ("birds of a feather" session) on a given topic.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6771.txt
6774	A			RFCs from 2012							"Distribution of Diverse BGP Paths" was released in November of 2012 by R. Raszuk, D. McPherson, K. Patel, R. Fernando, and K. Kumaki. The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a single best path for each prefix. As defined and widely deployed today, BGP has no mechanisms to distribute alternate paths that are not considered best path between its speakers. This behavior results in a number of disadvantages for new applications and services.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6774.txt
6775	A			RFCs from 2012							"Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)" was released in November of 2012 by Z. Shelby, C. Bormann, S. Chakrabarti, and E. Nordmark. The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  The document thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6775.txt
6776	A			RFCs from 2012							"Measurement Identity and Information Reporting Using a Source Description (SDES) Item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block" was released in October of 2012 by Q. Wu, and A. Clark. This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source Description (SDES) item and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) block carrying parameters that identify and describe a measurement period to which one or more other RTCP XR blocks may refer.

6777	A			RFCs from 2012							"Label Switched Path (LSP) Data Path Delay Metrics in Generalized MPLS and MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) Networks" was released in November of 2012 by R. Papneja, J. Gao, W. Sun, G. Xie, and G. Zhang. When setting up a Label Switched Path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) and MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) networks, the completion of the signaling process does not necessarily mean that the cross-connection along the LSP has been programmed accordingly and in a timely manner.  Meanwhile, the completion of the signaling process may be used by LSP users or applications that control their use as an indication that the data path has become usable.  The existence of the inconsistency between the signaling messages and cross-connection programming, and the possible failure of cross- connection programming, if not properly treated, will result in data loss or even application failure.  Characterization of this performance can thus help designers to improve the way in which LSPs are used and to make applications or tools that depend on and use LSPs more robust.  This document defines a series of performance metrics to evaluate the connectivity of the data path in the signaling process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6777.txt
6778	A			RFCs from 2012							"Requirements for Archiving IETF Email Lists and for Providing Web-Based Browsing and Searching" was released in October of 2012 by R. Sparks. The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  Participants frequently need to search and browse the archives of these lists and have asked for improved search capabilities.  The current archive mechanism could also be made more efficient.  This memo captures the requirements for improved email list archiving and searching systems.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6778.txt
6779	A			RFCs from 2012							"Definition of Managed Objects for the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol" was released in October of 2012 by I. Chakeres, R. Cole, and U. Herberg. This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports state, performance information, and notifications about NHDP.  This additional state and performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues during neighbor discovery. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6779.txt
6780	A			RFCs from 2012							"RSVP ASSOCIATION Object Extensions" was released in October of 2012 by A. Narayanan, F. Le Faucheur, and L. Berger. The RSVP ASSOCIATION object was defined in the context of GMPLS-controlled Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  In this context, the object is used to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.  This object also has broader applicability as a mechanism to associate RSVP state.  This document defines how the ASSOCIATION object can be more generally applied.  This document also defines Extended ASSOCIATION objects that, in particular, can be used in the context of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  This document updates RFC 2205, RFC 3209, and RFC 3473.  It also generalizes the definition of the Association ID field defined in RFC 4872.

6782	A			RFCs from 2012							"Wireline Incremental IPv6" was released in November of 2012 by L. Howard, and V. Kuarsingh. Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for or deploying IPv6 in their networks.  These operators often face difficult challenges related to IPv6 introduction, along with those related to IPv4 run-out.  Operators will need to meet the simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support for IPv4 connectivity for legacy devices with a stagnant supply of IPv4 addresses.  The IPv6 transition will take most networks from an IPv4- only environment to an IPv6-dominant environment with long transition periods varying by operator.  This document helps provide a framework for wireline providers who are faced with the challenges of introducing IPv6 along with meeting the legacy needs of IPv4 connectivity, utilizing well-defined and commercially available IPv6 transition technologies.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6782.txt
6783	A			RFCs from 2012							"Mailing Lists and Non-ASCII Addresses" was released in November of 2012 by J. Levine, and R. Gellens. It obsoletes <a href="/?q=RFC+5983">RFC 5983</a>. This document describes considerations for mailing lists with the introduction of non-ASCII UTF-8 email addresses.  It outlines some possible scenarios for handling lists with mixtures of non-ASCII and traditional addresses but does not specify protocol changes or offer implementation or deployment advice.  This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).	http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6783.txt
6784	A			RFCs from 2012							"Kerberos Options for DHCPv6" was released in November of 2012 by M. Ishiyama, and S. Sakane.

6785	A			RFCs from 2012							"Support for Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Events in Sieve" was released in November of 2012 by B. Leiba. Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle, plug into any point in the processing of an email message.  As defined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can plug into points in IMAP where messages are created or changed, adding the option of user-defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features such as notifications).  Because this requires future Sieve extensions to specify their interactions with this one, this document updates the base Sieve specification, RFC 5228.
