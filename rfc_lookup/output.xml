<field name="paragraph"><![CDATA[A message switching protocol (MSP) is a system whose function is to switch messages among its ports.

For example, there is an implementation of an MSP in each Interface Message Processor.  We believe that the effective utilization of communications networks by computer operating systems will require a better understanding of MSPs.  In particular, we feel that Network Control Programs (NCPs), as they have been implemented on the ARPA Computer Network (ARPANET), do not adequately emphasize the communications aspects of networking -- i.e., they reflect a certain reluctance on the part of systems people to move away from what we term "the stream orientation".  We propose, as an aside the network development using the current NCPs, to rethink the design of NCP-level software beginning with a consideration of MSPs.

The thrust of this note is to sketch how one would organize the lowest level host-host protocol in the ARPANET around MSPs and how this organization would affect the implementation of host software.]]></field>
