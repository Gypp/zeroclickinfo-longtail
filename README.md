DuckDuckGo Longtail Plugins
=================================

See [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com/) for an overview of the DuckDuckGo plugin system.

This repository is for contributing longtail plugins. Each longtail plugin produces a (generally large) data file that gets used for showing answers in [long tail queries](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=i'm+a+walking+contradiction+lyrics).

Longtail plugins are in alpha and both the interface and testing procedure are not yet well defined. However, you can work away without worrying about what any changes might do to your plugins -- we'll take care of all that.
